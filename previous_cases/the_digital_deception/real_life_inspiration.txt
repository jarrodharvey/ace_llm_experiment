JA: I agree with RS Hulme J and the orders which he proposes.   RS
HULME J: On 15 October 2010, this Applicant for leave to appeal was sentenced by
Garling DCJ in respect of a number of offences.
In summary, the offences, the
statutory provision relating to them and the maximum penalties provided are as
follows:-  1.Having sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years
and under his authority - Crimes Act 1900 - s 66A(2) - life
imprisonment.   2.Having sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years and under
his authority - Crimes Act 1900 - s 66A(2) - life imprisonment.   3.Possessing child abuse material - Crimes Act 1900 - s 91H(2) - 10
years.   4.Using a carriage service in a way that reasonable persons would regard as
offensive - Commonwealth Criminal Code 1995 - s 474.17.   5.Using a child then under 14 for pornographic purposes - Crimes Act 1900 - s 91G - 14 years.    The
first two offences have, pursuant to the provisions of s 54A et seq of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 a standard non-parole period of 15
years.   The
child involved, then aged 9, was the son of the Applicant and his wife, who was
a co-offender in the case of the offence the subject
of the fifth count and the
third offence on the Form 1. The victim had resided with his parents since
birth. The authorities first
became aware of problems when the child commenced
exhibiting unusual and inappropriate sexual conduct at school.   The
Applicant and his wife seem to have had an open attitude towards nudity. One of
his remarks to police officers was, "I understand
that you think we are wrong,
but we think the human body is art and to be admired". He also made the point
that no violence or pain
had been inflicted, observing also that we are a "very
touchy feely family". It is clear also from the Facts Summary tendered before
Garling DCJ that at least the first 4 charges were but representative of a
course of conduct engaged in over a substantial period.   From
time to time, an online chat programme was used and activities photographed by
video camera and broadcast on that chat programme.
Sometimes similar activities
of others were watched by a similar method.   The
circumstances of the first offence were that the Applicant and his son were on
the Applicant's bed before school one morning watching
television. The child was
in a nightie and the Applicant was nude. The Applicant felt the child's penis
and then commenced to suck
it. Before the child when to school, the Applicant
told him, "Don't you tell anyone about this".   The
second charge arises from remarks of the Applicant during a police interview in
which he acknowledged allowing the complainant
to suck his penis. He told police
words to the effect, "It's just a quick suck, he doesn't stay there because he's
too young to sort
of know to do any different. It's just in the art of bonding
with your child". Asked whether that resulted in the Applicant having
an
erection, the Applicant said words to the effect, "Probably started to, it
wouldn't have been a full one 'cause he's not there
long enough to make it
full".   The
third count arose in consequence of the police finding images on the Applicant's
computer. One included an unknown blonde female
child of about 8 being both
anally and vaginally sexually assaulted by an adult male, the child appearing to
be clearly distressed,
crying and wearing a black dog collar with silver
coloured studs. Also depicted was a young female child naked with legs apart
while
an adult female performed cunnilingus upon her.   Asked
if there was any material showing the complainant in sexually explicit
positions, the Applicant said:-  There shouldn't be. I can't recall taking any. Maybe just one, a
picture of him and I playing on a bed both with a hard on as it was
just
something that happened. Very funny.    The
Applicant also admitted that he probably had more than 100 photographs and had
been receiving child pornography on his computer
for a couple of years. Asked
whether there were any images of children performing sexual acts upon adults,
the Applicant replied:-  Yes, there will be, yes - if it's been forced sex I don't like it,
but if it's a normal thing that happens and - the children are
consenting to
this, well why not.    The
fourth count also arose in consequence of what was recorded on the computer. The
Applicant and another male had communicated via
Yahoo Messenger on 53 separate
days. On each occasion, the two males were nude and masturbating and on some
occasions the Applicant
and his wife were fondling each other. The conversation
which was recorded on many these occasions was of a sexually explicit
nature.   The
fifth count arose out of an occasion when the complainant and his mother were
lying on the bed in the early morning watching a
DVD movie "Harry Potter and the
Chamber of Secrets". The Applicant entered the room carrying a web cam and said
to his wife, "Suck
(the complainant's) dick to show them that you can play too".
The Applicant's wife rolled over towards the complainant and sucked
his penis.
Asked about this incident, the Applicant said:-  We talk to a lot of nudists from around the world and you like to
cam with other families and I'm sure if he is sitting beside me
and we are
camming with another family, he has been there with me. We are just proving to
people that we are real.    Three
offences on a Form 1 were also taken into account. The first two of these were
of committing an act of indecency towards the
complainant, a child then under
10, an offence under the Crimes Act , s 61O(2). The third was an
aggravated indecent assault, an offence under s 61M(2). The first offence was
constituted by the Applicant's wife massaging the Applicant's penis to
ejaculation in the presence of the complainant.
The second consisted of the
Applicant massaging the complainant. Asked whether the massage involved sexual
contact, the Applicant
replied to the effect:-  Of course, you are going to rub the genital area, aren't you? It
might happen once every three weeks, it might happen once every couple
of days,
it might not happen for a long while ... he likes to have his penis rubbed a
little bit ... he's obviously going to get
hard very quickly, even for a 9 year
old.    The
third offence on the Form 1 was evidenced by a video recording of the
Applicant's wife fellating him in the presence of the complainant
sitting less
than a metre away and watching.   After
allowing a discount of 25% for the Applicant's plea, the sentences imposed were
as follows:-  Count 1: Imprisonment for 10 years including a non-parole period of
7 years, both such periods commencing on 16 November 2011.   Count 2: Imprisonment for 8 years including a non-parole period of 6 years,
both such periods commencing on 16 November 2011.   Count 3: Imprisonment for 3 years including a non-parole period of 1 year,
both such periods commencing on 16 November 2010.   Count 4: Imprisonment for a fixed term of 1 year commencing on 16 November
2010.   Count 5: Imprisonment for 3 years including a non-parole period of 1 year
commencing on 16 November 2009    The
effective sentence thus was imprisonment for 12 years including a non-parole
period of 9 years, both such periods commencing on
16 November 2009.   The
grounds of appeal are:-  1.The judge erred in the assessment of the objective seriousness of
offences 1 and 2 by taking into account irrelevant considerations   2.The judge erred in assessing the objective seriousness of offences 1 and 2
as "above the mid-range" and "somewhere in the middle
of the mid to high
range".    Garling
DCJ addressed the question of where the first two offences fell in the range of
objective seriousness. As the grounds of appeal
reflect, he found they were
above the mid-range and somewhere in the middle of the mid to high range.
Summarised, his reasons for
so concluding were that:-  1.There was a gross breach of trust. I accept that part of the
charge is that the child was under authority but, at this stage, I'm
trying to
place the offences within a range. It is hard to imagine a greater breach of
trust than what the male offender has committed.
This is his son who was
entitled to be protected by his father, not abused by him. His on has now lost
both his parents and, until
18 years of age, will be in care.   2.There has been significant emotional harm. I have set out that harm at an
earlier stage and you add to it what I have just said,
that is, the emotional
harm of losing both parents.   3.The offences took place over a fairly lengthy period of time.   4.I also have to look at the overall series of offences which includes the
use of the internet.    His
Honour also observed that he was "satisfied in JM's sentence that counts 1 and 2
should be concurrent as they are part of the
one set of sexual behaviour".   His
Honour rejected a Crown submission that the Applicant's offences fell into the
worst category or into the upper range of offending
because:-  1.There was no penile penetration or the like.   2.The complainant was 9, an age not far removed from the maximum with which s
66BA is concerned.   3.There was no physical injury or threat.   4.The Court sees cases where the factual situation is significantly worse and
the abuse goes on for a longer time.    His
Honour observed that the statistical information with which he had been provided
was of no assistance because of the wide range
of sentences. He expressed the
view that although there should be accumulation of some of the sentences, the
sentences on Counts
1 and 2 should be concurrent "as they are part of the one
set of sexual behaviour".   His
Honour recorded that the Applicant was in his late 50s at the time of sentence,
had no prior criminal record. His Honour was prepared
to assume he was
previously a person of good character. His Honour found special circumstances
but the partial accumulation he proposed
would take those into account. He
accepted that the Applicant would probably have to serve his sentence in
protective custody but
his Honour did not regard this as a significant matter
because, as he said, such a situation is dealt with by the prison authorities
on
a regular basis.   His
Honour also had before him a report from a psychologist Joanne Mercer concerning
the condition of the victim and in particular
the impact that his parents'
actions had had on him. On the topic his Honour remarked:-  The Crown tendered a report from Joanne Mercer, clinical
psychologist. It was objected to, however, I allowed it but I will take care
with the report as it contains material that goes beyond the agree facts and was
obtained for care proceedings. The complainant is
now under the responsibility
of the Department of Community Services and he is in care. His parents are not
permitted to have any
contact with him until he attains eighteen years of age.
This report was tendered in relation to both offenders to show that there
was an
aggravating factor, that is, significant emotional harm. Ms Mercer said: 'The
emotional impacts for the child are twofold.
He is struggling emotionally with
an abundance of guilty relating to the consequences his parents are facing. This
stems from the
sense of responsibility bestowed on him from his parents. He does
not fully recognise that he has been through an abusive and traumatic
situation.
He is about to begin a complex and long-term therapeutic process that requires
him to challenge nearly all his ingrained
beliefs and trust'.   This opinion could hardly be controversial. This young boy was sexually
abused by his parents, those are the facts they agree to.
I do not need a
medical report to tell me that this young boy would have suffered emotional
harm, however, the report, as far as
any non-controversial part of it is
concerned, clearly confirms that. I find that, as a result of the actions of the
offenders, their
son has suffered significant emotional harm.   Grounds 1 and 2    There
can be no doubt that this ground is made out. His Honour's reasons recorded
above demonstrate that in assessing the criminality
involved in the first and
second offences, he took into account "the overall series of offences which
includes the use of the internet"
and, it is clearly to be inferred, the impact
of the course of conduct indulged in by both his parents over an extended
period. The
first two offences were not related to the internet in any way and
while there was evidence that the first offence had occurred a
few weeks prior
to the victim being interviewed on 16 November 2009, there was no evidence as to
the date upon which the second offence
occurred beyond the terms of the charge
which identified the time as between 1 January and 10 November 2009. Accordingly
his Honour's
sentencing of the Applicant in respect of these offences
miscarried.   His
Honour's errors must also have affected his characterisation of these offences
as "above the mid-range" and "somewhere in the
middle of the mid to high range".
It is not suggested that the matter should be remitted to the District Court and
it accordingly
falls to this Court to re-sentence the Applicant on the first and
second counts. The Court may also make whatever adjustments may
be appropriate
to the starting dates of the other sentences - see Criminal Appeal Act 1912 , s 7(1A).    There
were other errors in his Honour's sentencing. Although it may be inferred that
the offences the subject of count 1 and 2 did
not occur on the one occasion,
there was no basis for concluding that they "took place over a fairly lengthy
period of time". Furthermore
they were sufficiently different and, not having
occurred on the one occasion, there was no legitimate basis for his Honour to
have
made the sentence for the offence the subject of count 2 entirely
concurrent with the sentence imposed for the count 1 offence.   During
the hearing of the appeal the Crown criticised his Honour's reference to having
seen worse cases, submitting that this fact
should not have influenced his
Honour's consideration of the objective seriousness of the case before him.
However, his Honour's
reference to the topic was rather in the context of
placing the instant case in the range of offending against the statutory
provision
and not in judging its own objective seriousness. In this respect he
did not err.   Relevant
in the task of re-sentencing the Applicant are some other findings to which
reference must be made. Although his Honour had
before him a report and evidence
from a psychologist who had conducted an extensive interview with the Applicant
and had formed the
view that the Applicant posed a moderate-low risk of
re-offending, his Honour concluded that it would be impossible for him to make
any worthwhile finding in that regard. His Honour also took the view that the
Applicant had been sexually abusing the victim and
doing it for his own sexual
gratification. There was evidence that justified that conclusion.   During
the appeal the Crown also drew attention to his Honour's finding that the
Applicant had committed a gross breach of trust,
drawing attention to the
recognition in MRW v R  [2011] NSWCCA 260 at [77] that this is a concept
distinct from abuse of authority that is an element of the offence (albeit,
because of the possibility of
double counting, one to which a sentencing judge
should be careful not to give too much weight) - see MRW v R at [78].
When to this was added the fact that the Applicant's wife was complicit in some
of the Applicant's offences, and had committed
others, the result was that the
victim had effectively lost both parents for the duration of his childhood. The
Crown submitted also
that the victim was left not only with the trauma normally
suffered by victims who had been abused, but also with the feelings of
guilt, in
consequence of what he had said when interviewed by the authorities, of being
responsible for his parents' incarceration.   I
have no difficulty in accepting that all of the matters just referred to
properly go in aggravation of the Applicant's offending,
though it is also
proper to recognise that in some respects the circumstances of the offending are
likely not to have been as traumatic
as those experienced by many victims whose
situation the Court has to consider.   During
the hearing of the appeal, and against the possibility that this Court should
re-sentence, an affidavit from by the Applicant
was read stating that he has
participated in a programme preparatory to participation in the CUBIT programme
but that he has been
informed that he will not be allowed to participate in the
latter until his last 12 to 18 months in custody. While in custody he
has not
had any institutional charges laid against him and because he is in protective
custody, apart for a period of 3 months he
spent in Long Bay correctional
Centre, he has been unable to obtain employment.   Although
I do not take other offences committed by the Applicant towards the victim as
aggravating the offending charged, the fact
that there were an appreciable
number of such offences means that the offences the subject of counts 1 and 2
cannot be looked at
as isolated occasions.   In
the result, recognising that the offences the subject of counts 1 and 2 were
separate from each other, and though each was very
serious, I do not
characterise them as highly as did Garling DCJ. However, the sentences for them
should be at least partially accumulated.
Garling DCJ found special
circumstances as I would have done in light of the accumulation of sentences. In
respect of count 1 I would
propose that the Applicant be sentenced to
imprisonment for a non-parole period of 4 years, together with a further term of
3 years
and for count 2, to a non-parole period of 4 years with a further term
of 16 months. I would structure these sentences so that there
combined effect is
no longer than the sentence for count 1 imposed by Garling DCJ.   Thus
although the application for leave to appeal has been successful in that it has
been shown that Garling DCJ erred and the sentences
he imposed on counts 1 and 2
were affected by those errors, the effective sentence imposed on the Applicant
will not be reduced.
That flows from the fact that, in my view, the offending
the subject of counts 1 and 2 merited the effective sentence imposed for
these
counts. Indeed, had I taken the view that the sentences for counts 1 and 2
should be reduced below the level imposed by Garling
DCJ, there is much to be
said for the view that, as counsel for the Applicant was advised, the degree of
concurrency of the sentences
for counts 3 to 5 should have been revisited, and
this even though there was no Crown appeal. At least the non-prole period for
the
third and fifth offences were very lenient.   Accordingly,
I propose the following orders:-  (1)Allow the appeal.   (2)Quash the sentences imposed by Garling DCJ on 15 October 2010 in respect
of Counts 1 and 2 and in lieu thereof re-sentence the
applicant as follows:-   (a)In respect of Count 2, sentence the applicant to imprisonment for a
non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 16 November 2011
together with a
further term of 16 months.   (b)In respect of Count 1, sentence the applicant to imprisonment for a
non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 16 November 2014
together with a
further term of 3 years.   (c)Record as the date upon which it appears to the Court that the applicant
shall become eligible for parole 16 November 2018.    FULLERTON
