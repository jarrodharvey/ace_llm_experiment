  "content": "FABRICATED TESTIMONIES:\n\n- **Marcus Sterling**: With grandiose bravado, declares he was in his home office all afternoon, not in the filing room. Stresses he\u2019d never use \u201cthose confounded machines.\u201d Insists he was nowhere near the crime scene at all.\n   - **LIE**: Security Access Logs contradict his alibi.\n   - **BREAKDOWN**: Rips off his shirt, revealing a tee with \u201cI LOVE COMPUTERS\u201d and mutters about his secret cyber obsession.\n\n- **Detective Harrison**: Flatly states only Elena could access the security system due to exclusive passcodes. Asserts the system was not hacked, rendering other suspects impossible. \n   - **LIE**: Administrative Override Codes show the system could be accessed by other employees.  \n   - **BREAKDOWN**: Stumbles over his words, spills coffee on his previously pristine white shirt, and frantically tries to clean it with a floppy disc.\n\n- **Sarah Chen**: Asserts with teary eyes that Elena was already in the office when she arrived at 3:00 PM. Claims she had no interaction with the judge that day.\n   - **LIE**: The Poisoned Coffee Cup evidence shows Sarah served the judge his coffee that day.\n   - **BREAKDOWN**: Starts pulling her hair and confesses she saw Marcus lurking around suspiciously.\n\n- **Dr. Foster**: Announces, with flamboyant gestures and exclamations, that the judge had no investigation plans, dismissing the idea as preposterous.\n   - **LIE**: The Judge's Personal Investigation Notes contradict his claim.\n   - **BREAKDOWN**: Faints dramatically, then upon waking, admits he was aware of the investigation but feared for his safety.\n\nZANY PROSECUTOR:\n- **Vincent Hawthorne**: A technophobe who constantly types on an antiquated typewriter, using it as a shield when under pressure. His catchphrase is \u201cThe truth is not a typographical error!\u201d\n\nGALLERY REACTIONS:\n- **Madame Misty**: A spirit medium gasping as lies are exposed, her crystal ball glowing ominously.\n- **Larry Butz**: A frequent troublemaker, shouting at the witnesses in disbelief, throwing popcorn around.\n\nJUDGE CHAOS:\n- The judge obsesses over trivial details like why Detective Harrison decided to clean his shirt with a floppy disc, completely missing the actual contradiction.\n\nEXCITEMENT CHECK: Solid 8.5/10 for AUTHENTIC AA DRAMA! For improvements, consider adding more impossible but logical elements, like spirit channeling or time-traveling witnesses. Reveal more intricacies to the crime scene, like an elaborate setup that only an insider could construct.",
