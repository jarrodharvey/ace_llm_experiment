He appeared genuinely distressed and cooperated fully with initial questioning. His explanation about delivering evidence seemed consistent, though I was skeptical of his claims about transcript tampering. The security footage clearly showed him entering the chambers at 3:55 PM with a package. Margaret Winters provided excellent cooperation and helped explain court procedures I wasn't familiar with.",

I've seen David working late many nights, but he's never accessed the evidence vault - his clearance doesn't allow it.",

This particular solvent is used in specialized cleaning processes and would have caused death within 30 minutes of exposure.

Based on the toxicology timeline, exposure occurred around 3:30 PM, meaning death occurred approximately 3:42 PM.",
