# Ace Attorney Case V5: The Catalyst Conspiracy

## Case Overview (Non-Spoiler)

A murder at a high-security pharmaceutical research facility has all the evidence pointing to one suspect - but Phoenix Wright believes there's more to the story. When a junior researcher is framed for the murder of his mentor, Phoenix must navigate corporate bureaucracy, hostile witnesses, and digital evidence manipulation to uncover the truth.

## Innovation: Hybrid Backbone + Obstacles Approach

This case uses a new two-phase development approach:

**Phase 1: Logical Backbone (Claude)**
- Built comprehensive case structure with logical consistency
- Created evidence chain that leads from crime scene to real killer
- Designed realistic characters with clear motivations
- Established timeline that supports all events

**Phase 2: Obstacle Design (Claude + ChatGPT Collaboration)**
- Consulted ChatGPT for creative obstacle suggestions
- Validated obstacles against logical backbone
- Integrated challenges that enhance rather than break the case
- Created "uphill battle" gameplay while maintaining solvability
