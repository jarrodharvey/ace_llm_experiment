      "content": "I have a logical Ace Attorney case backbone. I need you to design challenging obstacles that make this case an \"uphill battle\" for Phoenix Wright while keeping the logical structure intact.\n\nCASE BACKBONE:\n- Victim: Dr. Elena Vasquez (research scientist poisoned with cyanide)\n- Client: Marcus Chen (junior researcher, framed for murder)\n- Real Killer: Dr. Hawthorne (security head selling secrets, killed Elena when she discovered him)\n- Method: Poisoned coffee + digital evidence manipulation\n- Evidence: 7 pieces including forensics, security footage, financial records, witness testimony\n- Characters: 6 total including hostile witnesses, overworked detective, nervous security guard\n\nDesign obstacles that:\n1. Make witnesses hostile/uncooperative without breaking their logical knowledge\n2. Hide evidence behind realistic challenges (bureaucracy, personal conflicts, etc.)\n3. Create misdirection that doesn't contradict facts\n4. Make the client appear MORE guilty initially\n5. Force Phoenix to work hard for every piece of information\n6. Add dramatic tension without logical inconsistencies\n\nFor each piece of evidence, suggest:\n- Why it's initially hidden/hard to get\n- What challenge Phoenix must overcome\n- How characters will resist sharing information\n- What false leads can be created\n\nFor each character, suggest:\n- Personal reason to dislike/distrust Phoenix\n- How they'll be unhelpful while staying truthful\n- What they'll hide and why\n- How they can misdirect without lying\n\nEXCITEMENT CHECK: Rate this case 1-10 for drama/excitement and suggest improvements.\n\nReturn as structured JSON format with specific obstacles for each evidence piece and character."
