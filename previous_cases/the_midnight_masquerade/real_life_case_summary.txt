COURT: Background to this application  On 27 October 2015 the respondent was arrested and charged with the following
offences:  (1)	Common assault: s 61  Crimes Act 1900 . (2)	Throw explosive substance with intent to do grievous bodily harm: s 47  Crimes Act . (3)	Use offensive weapon with intent to intimidate: s 33B(1)(a)  Crimes

and Personal Violence) Act 2007 . (5)	Damage property by fire: s 195(1)(b) Crimes
Act .  On
25 January 2016 the respondent made a release application before Davies J
pursuant to s 49 of the Bail Act 2013 (the Act). The respondent was
not represented on that application.  Bail
was granted, subject to the following conditions:  (a)	To be of
good behaviour;  (b)	To report
to Balmain Police Station between 8am and 6pm every Monday, Wednesday and
Saturday;  (c)	To live at
xxxx Henry Street, Leichhardt NSW;  (d)	Not to go
within 1km of Forestville for any reason;  (e)	Not to
associate or communicate by any means (except through his lawyer) with TS, TW
and Z.  On
29 January 2016 the Crown made a detention application pursuant to s 50 of
the Act. The papers relating to the application were served on the
respondent on Wednesday, 3 February 2016.  The
application was heard on 5 February 2016. After the completion of submissions
the Court made orders granting the application and
revoking the
respondent’s bail. The Court stated that reasons would be provided at a
later date. This judgment constitutes
those reasons. Factual
background   The
following narrative, which is disputed by the respondent in a number of
respects, sets out the Crown case against him. There is
independent
corroboration of important parts of the Crown case.  The
respondent had previously been in a relationship with Ms S (the complainant) for
a period of about six months. The complainant
lived in Starkey Street in
Forestville. She resided there with her ex-partner, TW, and their child, Z, who
is aged five. The premises
comprised two bedrooms and is on the first floor of a
block of units. The complainant is also the owner of a silver Toyota Yaris
motor
vehicle.  In
her statement the complainant said that over the period of their relationship,
the respondent was subject to “massive mood
swings”. He would go
from being “really kind and loving” to abusive and aggressive very
quickly. On one occasion
early in the relationship, the respondent slapped the
complainant. That was the only episode of physical violence until the events
the
subject of the charges against the respondent.  The
complainant said that on Saturday, 24 October 2015 she decided that she would
end the relationship and she did not go to the respondent’s
house as had
been previously planned. This caused the respondent to make a number of abusive
calls and send text messages to both
the complainant and to TW. The complainant
did not call the police at that time because she did not have any reason to be
frightened
of the respondent.  At
approximately 7.20am on 27 October 2015 the respondent telephoned the
complainant and in the course of that conversation was told
by her that TW was
not home but had gone to work. At approximately 8am the respondent knocked on
the complainant’s door. When
the complainant opened the door to him, he
pushed his way in causing her to back away. The respondent then raised a spray
bottle
which he was holding to head height. The complainant described it as a
“regular cleaning style bottle”. The bottle was
full of a clear
liquid. The respondent began to spray the complainant with the contents of the
bottle, aiming for her eyes and face.
The complainant noticed a strong smell,
which she thought could be either petrol or turpentine.  The
respondent continued spraying the liquid over the complainant’s face.
Every time he sprayed her, she took a step backwards
and he kept moving forward
pushing her down the hallway towards the kitchen with his left hand. While this
was occurring, the complainant
noticed that the liquid was causing a burning
sensation to her face.  The
complainant said that while he was pushing her down the hall, the respondent was
saying words to the effect “Bitch, you
want to fuck with gangsters. This
is what happens when you fuck with gangsters. This is it bitch, I don’t
care if I go back
to gaol.”  Eventually
the complainant stopped at the entrance to the kitchen and the respondent
continued to spray the liquid on her. There was
a large amount of liquid on her
face at that point and it was dripping from her face onto her shirt. The
respondent said “You
won’t use those eyes again. Say goodbye to that
face”.  The
respondent moved the spray bottle to his left hand and brought out a black,
rectangular shaped lighter. He flicked the lid of
the lighter off with one hand
and ignited the flame. He ran the flame along the complainant’s clothes at
about stomach height,
which caused her to jump backwards. The respondent
continued to move towards the complainant, raising the flame towards her face.
It got within centimetres of her face when she pushed his arm away. The
respondent brought the lighter and flame back towards the
complainant’s
face about four or five times and each time she pushed his arm away because she
was afraid that the flame would
ignite the fluid on her face.  Eventually
the complainant was able to push her way past the respondent towards the
entrance to the unit. She heard the respondent
say “Where’s Z?
Where’s Z? Hey Z, hey Z come here.” The respondent walked into
Z’s room while still
holding the spray bottle. He looked around for Z but
did not see him and then left his room. (Z was in fact hiding under the bed.)
The respondent said “You’re nothing but a whore. This is what whores
get. This is your last day. I don’t care about
going back to
gaol.”  The
complainant ran out the front door of the unit and unsuccessfully sought help
from neighbours. She was followed by the respondent.
The complainant succeeded
in avoiding the respondent and was able to return to her unit after which she
closed the door. The complainant
then called the Manly Police and described what
had happened. Approximately five minutes later, she heard a knock at her front
door.
She heard a male voice which said “It’s the police. It’s
the police. It’s the police.” The complainant
telephoned the Manly
Police Station and was able to confirm that the police had not yet arrived at
her unit. The complainant did
not open the door and waited inside until police
arrived.  By
the time police arrived, the complainant’s eyes and face were burning. She
took off the clothes which she was wearing at
the time and gave them to police
before having a shower to wash the substance from her face. She then
participated in a video interview
with police.  At
the conclusion of her statement, the complainant said “I am scared that
Milan will come and try to hurt me again in the future.
He’s bragged to me
in the past about his criminal record and that he associates with outlaw
motorcycle groups and gangsters.
I am very scared of him”.  Subsequently
the complainant’s car (which was in a nearby carpark) was found to have
sustained a large burned area on the offside
front bonnet. Photographs of this
damage were before the Court and it is clear from those photographs that this
part of the motor
vehicle had been burned by some substance.  The
police were able to retrieve the texts apparently sent by the respondent to TW
in the days before 27 October 2015. Included in
those texts were the
following: 26.10.2015 – 10:37:28 – “Can u catch
petrol”  26.10.2015 – 10:49:53 – “Oh scare of so scared  petrol what a great invention”   Although
the respondent initially denied going to the complainant’s unit on 27
October, he subsequently admitted that he had
done so in the proceedings before
Davies J. Police also obtained CCTV footage which showed the respondent carrying
a backpack and
travelling in the direction of the complainant’s unit at a
time fully consistent with the events described by the complainant.  Scientific
tests were carried out in relation to some of the liquid residue located on the
kitchen floor. Tests were also carried
out on the pink jumper and grey track
pants worn by the complainant at the time. The results of those tests
were: “A medium petroleum distillate was detected in the contents of these
items. Medium petroleum distillates can be found in a variety of products including
mineral spirits, low odour mineral turpentine; low odour
kerosene, some paint
thinners, dry cleaning solvents and aerosol lubricants.”  Police
obtained statements from a number of eyewitnesses which confirmed not only that
the respondent was outside the complainant’s
unit as alleged by her, but
that he was holding a plastic bottle.  On
29 October 2015 the respondent participated in an electronically recorded
interview with police. Without going into detail, there
are a number of
inconsistencies between what the respondent said in that interview and matters
which have been independently established
by evidence other than that provided
by the complainant. Most particularly, the respondent denied that he had been at
the unit at
8am on the morning of the 27th October (Q.332 – 333).  The
respondent has a long criminal record dating back to 1975 although there has
been minimal offending since 2002. The respondent
has not been in prison since
2002 and his offending since that time has been sporadic and minor. The only
offences of violence on
his criminal record appear very early in that record.
The majority of offending since that early period related to drug and property
offending.  The
respondent owns the house in which he resides. At the time of the events with
which he has been charged, the respondent was unemployed.
The respondent was in
custody from the date of his arrest on 29 October 2015 until he was released on
bail on 25 January 2016. There
was material before the Court which indicated
that on 24 December 2015 while the respondent was in custody, an order was made
pursuant
to s 55(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 directing that he be transferred to a mental health facility as he appeared
to be a mentally ill person. He was transferred to that
mental health facility
in prison on 20 January 2016. On 25 January 2016 he was reviewed by two doctors
at the mental health facility
when it was determined that he was a mentally ill
person and as such, a s 56(2) order was issued directing that he was to
remain in a mental health facility. The respondent was in that mental health
facility (unknown
to Davies J) when he successfully applied for bail.  As
a result of the respondent being granted bail on 25 January 2016, the respondent
was scheduled to the Prince of Wales Hospital
under the Mental Health Act 2007 . The respondent was assessed at the Prince of Wales Hospital on 2 February
2016 and was discharged.  Most
of the foregoing material was not before Davies J when he granted bail to the
respondent. At that time the Crown’s case
depended on the evidence of the
complainant being accepted in preference to that of the respondent. As can be
seen, the factual circumstances
had changed considerably by the date of the
detention application and the Crown case was much
stronger. Submissions   The
Crown accepted that the respondent did not have to show cause under s 16A
of the Act.  The
Crown accepted that for this application to succeed, it had to establish that
the continued liberty of the respondent amounted
to an “unacceptable
risk” which could not be sufficiently mitigated by the imposition of bail
conditions (s 20(1) of the Act).  The
Crown relied upon the following unacceptable risks which it submitted were made
out by considering the ongoing risk to the complainant
not only because of her
previous relationship with the respondent but as now being the person who had
made a complaint against him
of serious criminal offences:  (a)	Risk of
commission of a serious offence (s 17(2)(b) of the Act).  (b)	Risk of
danger to the complainant, individuals and community (s 17(2)(c) of the
Act).  (c)	Risk of
interference with witnesses or evidence (s 17(2)(d)).  The
Crown submitted that there was a very strong case against the respondent which
did not depend only upon the evidence of the complainant
and her former partner.
It was corroborated independently by eyewitnesses and objective material such as
the results of the forensic
tests of the liquid substance sprayed onto the
complainant. The Crown submitted that should the respondent be convicted of
these
offences he was likely to serve a significant period in prison. This
provided an incentive for him to take steps to weaken the Crown
case or
otherwise discourage the complainant from pursuing the matter.  The
Crown submitted that at the heart of the offences with which the respondent had
been charged was the concept of retaliation against
the complainant because she
sought to break off their relationship. The Crown submitted that this kind of
motivation gave rise to
a continuing risk that the respondent might again take
retaliatory action against the complainant, not only because of the failed
relationship but because she was now the instigator of the serious charges which
had been brought against him.  The
Crown submitted that the risk posed by the respondent to the complainant and her
family was serious and could not be said to have
been sufficiently mitigated by
the bail conditions imposed by the Court. The Crown submitted that the
respondent’s behaviour
was both premeditated and unusual. Had the
respondent been successful in his assault upon the complainant, she would have
suffered
serious injury and likely permanent disfigurement of her face. The
Crown submitted a further disturbing matter was the respondent’s
attempt
to find the child when his attempts to set fire to the complainant had been
unsuccessful.  The
Crown submitted that even if the conditions already imposed by the Court were
made more stringent, such as imposing a curfew and
more regular reporting, the
compliance with those conditions would still largely depend upon the motivation
of the respondent which
was highly problematic.  In
oral submissions, the respondent denied that he had committed the offences and
that he had carried out the actions attributed to
him by the complainant and TW.
He said that the complainant had not communicated any intention of breaking up
the relationship to
him and that he had been invited to go to her unit on 27
October.  The
respondent submitted that he needed to be at liberty so that he could arrange
for tests to be carried out in relation to his phone
and other phones so as to
make it clear that he was the person being threatened by texts, not the
complainant and TW. He submitted
that as a result of being in custody since 29
October 2015 and restrained at the Prince of Wales Hospital, he had not been
able to
pay bills relating to his residence and ran the risk of losing his home
if he were returned to custody. No further information was
provided in relation
to those matters. Consideration   As
was submitted by the Crown these are very serious offences. The Crown case is
strong and the respondent if convicted will undoubtedly
receive a significant
prison sentence. We accept that this provides motivation for him interfering
with the complainant and other
witnesses.  There
is also, as the Crown submitted, a somewhat unusual element in the offences
alleged against the respondent. The level of retaliation
appears to be out of
all proportion to the complainant’s actions. All that the complainant did
was to seek to end the relationship
which had only existed for a relatively
short period. There is a level of irrationality in the offences charged which
might be explained
by the mental health element which is referred to in the
factual material before the Court but which was not otherwise explored.  As
the Act makes clear, a court considering a bail application has to consider the
risks to which witnesses and complainants might
be exposed should the applicant
for bail be granted liberty. In this case, given the seriousness of the
offending and the otherwise
unexplained mental health elements which could lead
to the respondent behaving in an irrational manner, the Court is not satisfied
that the unacceptable risks identified by the Crown can be appropriately
ameliorated by bail conditions. Conclusion   It
was for the above reasons that the Court made orders on 5 February
2016. *********  Amendments  17 August 2018 - publication restriction removed - judgment published                Print    Print (pretty)    Print (eco-friendly)           Download    RTF format (238 KB)      Signed PDF/A format         Cited By    LawCite records    NoteUp references          Join the discussion    Tweet this page    Follow @AustLII on Twitter             About    Copyright & Usage    Privacy    Disclaimers    Help   http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCCA/2016/14.html
