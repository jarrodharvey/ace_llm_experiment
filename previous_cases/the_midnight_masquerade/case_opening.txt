FADE IN:

INT. APARTMENT - MORNING

A quaint, tidy apartment is bathed in the soft glow of morning light. The pictures on the wall tell the story of a woman, MS. S, who lives here with her young son, Z, and her ex-partner, TW. 

Suddenly, the serene silence is shattered by the harsh KNOCKING at the front door. The door creaks open to reveal MILAN DARKO PLETERSKI, a man with a sinister smile and a glint of madness in his eyes.

Pleterski forces his way in, causing Ms. S to stumble backward. He raises a spray bottle, full of a clear liquid. With a maniacal laugh, he begins to spray the liquid over Ms. S's face, the strong smell of petrol filling the room.

As Ms. S backs away, Pleterski menacingly advances, spouting threats and warnings. He switches the spray bottle to his left hand and pulls out a lighter with his right, flicking it open and igniting the flame. 

He attempts to run the flame along Ms. S's clothes, but she jumps back. The game of cat and mouse begins, with Ms. S avoiding the flame while Pleterski continues his assault.

Suddenly, Pleterski's attention shifts. He stalks towards Z's room, leaving Ms. S terrified. However, Z is hiding, safe under his bed. 

Taking advantage of this distraction, Ms. S runs out of the apartment, seeking help from her neighbors. But Pleterski follows her, a predator on the hunt. 

The chase ends back at the apartment, with Ms. S managing to lock Pleterski out. She calls the police, reporting the horrifying incident. As she waits for help to arrive, the burn on her face starts to sting, a painful reminder of Pleterski's brutal attack.

FADE OUT.
