CJ at CL: Following a trial in the District Court, on 2 and 3 December
2021 the applicant, WR, was found guilty of committing three
“historical”
sexual offences against his daughter, XX. On 27 May
2022, the applicant was sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of
5 years
with a non-parole period of 2 years. His sentence was fixed to
commence on 4 February 2022. He will be first eligible for release
on parole on
3 February 2024.  On
10 October 2022, the applicant filed a Notice of Appeal against his conviction.
His appeal is listed for hearing on 13 and 14 June
2023. He now applies for bail
pending the hearing of his appeal. To succeed on his application, the applicant
must, inter alia, demonstrate
that “special or exceptional
circumstances” exist to justify the grant of bail pending the appeal
( Bail Act 2013 (NSW), s 22(1)). For the reasons that follow, I
consider that the applicant has established such circumstances and bail should
be granted. The Offences   The
indictment presented against the applicant alleged that he committed two acts of
indecency against XX between 22 May 1977 and
24 May 1979 (counts 1 and 2),
one act of indecency against XX between 1 January and 31 December 1978
(count 3), unlawful carnal knowledge
upon XX between 1 January and 31
December 1983, when she was over the age of 10 and under the age of 17 (count
4), and had sexual
intercourse with XX without her consent between 22 May
1985 and 23 June 1986 (count 5). The applicant was found guilty on counts
1, 3
and 5 and acquitted on counts 2 and 4.  The
applicant was born in 1937. He was 84 years old at the time he stood trial and
is now 85. XX was born in 1968 and is the applicant’s
third child
from a previous marriage that ended around 1984. In respect of count 1, the
applicant was found to have indecently assaulted
XX on a camping trip and
masturbated in her presence afterwards. The allegation the subject of count 2
involved similar conduct on
a camping trip a few months later. As to count 3, it
was found that XX woke in her parents’ bed and the applicant
“spoon[ed]”
her and placed his fingers inside her vagina. When she
spoke up, he replied “[s]orry, I thought you were your mother”.
With
counts 4 and 5, it was respectively alleged (in the case of count 4) and found
(in the case of count 5) that XX stayed overnight
with the applicant and
woke up to find him having penile/vaginal intercourse with her. The applicant
gave evidence at the trial denying
the charges. Bail Pending
Appeal   Section
s 22(1) of the Bail Act provides that where an appeal is pending in
this Court against a conviction on indictment, the Court is not to grant bail
unless
it is established that “special or exceptional circumstances
exist”. If the subject offences are “show cause offences”,
then the requirement in s 22(1) replaces the “show cause”
requirement (s 22(2)). Otherwise, the approach of the Bail Act to
assessing “unacceptable risks” still pertains following a finding of
“special or exceptional circumstances” (s 22(3) ; see El‑Hilli and Melville v R  [2015] NSWCCA 146 at [13] ).  In El Khouli v R  [2019] NSWCCA 146 at [22] (“El Khouli”), this Court (Hoeben CJ at CL, Walton and Wilson
JJ) observed as follows in relation to s 22:  “... a distinction appears to have been drawn on the authorities, when the
grounds of appeal are advanced as a factor demonstrating
special or exceptional
circumstances, between cases where the strength or merit of an appeal has been
relied upon in isolation, and
those where the applicant relied upon that factor
in combination with other factors including whether the applicant would
have spent
a substantial part of his or her sentence in custody by the time of
the hearing of the appeal.” (emphasis added)   Their
Honours noted that in the former type of case the applicant must show
“more than that the grounds seem arguable”
and that it may be
necessary to establish that the appeal is “most likely to succeed”
( El Khouli at [23], citing Petroulias v R  [2010] NSWCCA 95 at [34] ).  In Fantakis v Director of Public Prosecutions  [2021] NSWCCA 271 at [12] (“Fantakis”), I observed as follows in relation to this aspect of El Khouli :  “I do not take El Khouli as specifying different thresholds
about the relative strength of the proposed grounds of appeal that must be shown
in order to demonstrate
special or exceptional circumstances. The above passage
from El Khouli identifies a particular matter that is often highly
relevant to a grant of bail pending an appeal, namely, whether an
‘applicant
would have spent a substantial part of his or her sentence in
custody by the time of the hearing of the appeal’. That circumstance
is
relevant to an assessment of whether special or exceptional circumstances have
been shown in that the appeal may be rendered futile,
or at least of lesser
utility, if there is no grant of bail. Often, the interaction between the
assessment of the relative strength
of the appeal and the utility of the appeal
will bear heavily upon whether or not special or exceptional circumstances exist
(see United Mexican States v Cabal  (2001) 209 CLR 165 ; [2001] HCA 60 at [41] ).”   To
the extent that an application for bail pending appeal requires an assessment of
the relative strength of the grounds of appeal,
the approach of this Court is
confined “to reaching only a broad overall view of an applicant's apparent
prospects” ( Obeid v R (No 2)  [2016] NSWCCA 321 at [17] (“Obeid”); Fantakis at [15]). Prospects of
Success on Appeal   The
applicant’s Notice of Appeal raises two grounds. The first ground of
appeal contends that a miscarriage of justice “occurred
by reason of the
fact that the [applicant] was not or may not have been fit to stand
trial”. The second ground of appeal contends
that the guilty verdicts on
counts 1 and 5 are unreasonable or cannot be supported, having regard to the
evidence.  The
submissions filed in support of the applicant’s appeal against his
conviction were made available on this bail application.
The submissions on
ground 2 complain about the supposed inconsistency between the guilty verdicts
on counts 1 and 5 compared with
the acquittals on counts 2 and 4, and otherwise
contend that XX’s evidence was unreliable. It is not necessary to consider
this ground further. The focus of the present application concerned ground 1 and
its relative strength.  The
operative principle governing an appeal against a conviction where the appellant
contends that they were unfit to stand trial
was stated in R v RTI  (2003)
58 NSWLR 438 ; [2003] NSWCCA 283 at [31] (“RTI”) as
follows:  “ If there is material before this Court which raises a question about
the propriety of the conviction because an appellant may have
been unfit to
stand trial, the court should quash the conviction unless it is satisfied
that, had the question been raised before or during the trial which led to the
conviction, the court acting reasonably must have found that the accused was
fit to stand trial. It is only if the court can come to that finding
that there
will be no possibility of a miscarriage of justice. I do not believe that
such a finding is open in the present case. Therefore, the convictions and
sentences must be quashed and a new
trial ordered.” (emphasis added)   The
first part of this passage appears to establish a relatively low threshold for
an appellant to satisfy in these circumstances,
although three matters should be
noted. First, a mere reduction in the capacity of an accused person to meet the
test of unfitness,
stated in R v Presser  [1958] VicRp 9 ; [1958] VR 45 , which “falls
short of denying to [an] accused the capacity to understand and
to follow the proceedings in each of the necessary aspects” is
insufficient
to constitute unfitness ( R v Rivkin  (2004) 59 NSWLR 284 ; [2004] NSWCCA 7 at [297] –[298]; “Rivkin”).  Second,
the Presser test is not satisfied merely because, due to some
psychological or cognitive condition, the accused displayed inappropriate
behaviour
in the trial, including while they gave evidence, provided that they
were “able to give evidence in relation to the matters
in issue ... had a
clear understanding of what was involved in the offence charged, and was able to
make the answer, which [the accused]
wished to make, in relation to it”
( Rivkin at [303]).  Third,
since March 2021, the test for determining whether an accused person is fit to
stand trial has been set out in s 36 of the Mental Health and Cognitive
Impairment Forensic Provisions Act 2020 (NSW) (the “MHCIFP
Act”). The effect of that provision is set out in the passage extracted
below from Dr Olav Nielssen’s
report. It suffices to state that s 36(1) is
clearly based on Presser . Applicant’s Evidentiary
Material concerning Fitness to be Tried   Consistent
with the above statements from Obeid and Fantakis , the parties
placed a confined set of evidentiary material before the Court in relation to
ground 1. The applicant read an affidavit
from his solicitor who has acted for
him since the time of his arrest in 2016. The solicitor recited the
applicant’s lengthy
medical history, which relevantly includes major heart
surgery in 1994 and recurrent cardiovascular issues since that time.  The
solicitor also notes that, after a number of adjournments, the applicant’s
trial commenced on 8 November 2021. The applicant
was represented by very
experienced Senior Counsel. The solicitor states that, during the trial, he
became concerned about the applicant’s
cognitive function. He says that in
November 2021, after the trial had commenced, he arranged for the applicant to
undergo a “CT
brain scan”, the results of which revealed no physical
abnormality. Despite these concerns, no question of fitness was raised
at the
trial. As noted, the applicant was called to give evidence in his case.  In
January 2022, while the applicant awaited sentencing, his solicitor obtained
reports from a geriatrician, Associate Professor Tuly
Rosenfeld, and Dr
Nielssen, a psychiatrist, which suggested that the applicant was suffering from
dementia and was cognitively impaired.
After the applicant was sentenced,
further reports were obtained from those experts addressing the
applicant’s fitness at the
time of his trial. Otherwise, the
solicitor’s affidavit included a self-admonishment for not addressing the
applicant’s
fitness to stand trial prior to his conviction.  The
applicant also tendered a report from his treating cardiologist dated 14
February 2022. The cardiologist concluded that there
was “clinical
evidence of progressive cognitive impairment”. The cardiologist opined
that, based on the applicant’s
age and degree of cognitive dysfunction, he
is “very likely [to] descend into frank dementia and ... life expectancy
in the
realm of 3 [years] or less”. 1   Based
on prior testing by a general practitioner, and his own interview with and
examination of the applicant, Associate Professor
Rosenfeld concluded that the
applicant “has multiple causes for the occurrence and progression of brain
disease which is more
likely than not associated with vascular disease of the
brain”. [1] He subsequently
concluded that the vascular brain disease has resulted “in degenerative
changes of his brain, cognitive impairment
and dementia that [have] as well as
other impairments in cognitive function prominently affected frontal lobe
executive function”. [2] Associate Professor Rosenfeld opined that these impairments were present during
November and December 2021 and
added: [3]  “In my opinion therefore [WR] was then and is not currently or in the
future, as his cognitive function continues to deteriorate,
properly able to
undertake, properly understand, respond to the proceedings or explanation and
advice nor with due reasoning and
judgement instruct his legal representatives
in legal proceedings.”   Based
on his own interview and testing, as well as Associate Professor
Rosenfeld’s reports, Dr Nielssen diagnosed the applicant
with
dementia. [4] In his later report of 4
September 2022, Dr Nielssen addressed the applicant’s fitness to stand
trial by reference to the criteria
in s 36(1) of the MHCIFP Act, as
follows [5] :  “With regards your further question, I believe that at the time of the two
assessments [WR] was unfit for trial according to
the criteria set out in section 36 of the Mental Health and Cognitive Impairment Forensic
Provisions Act , on the basis of the effect of his cognitive function on his
ability to follow any proceedings, provide reliable instructions to his legal
representatives and on
his ability to give coherent evidence on his own
behalf . With regards the specific criteria, was [WR] able to:  (a) understand the offence the subject of the proceedings [WR] was aware of the charges he faced.  (b) plead to the charge [WR] was consistent in his account of how he would plead to the charge.  (c) exercise the right to challenge jurors [WR] had some knowledge of the composition and function of a jury.  (d) understand generally the nature of the proceedings as an inquiry into
whether the person committed the offence with which the
person is charged [WR] understood the general nature of the proceedings.  (e) follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on
in a general sense [WR] has a condition that affects his ability to concentrate and retain
information, and he would be unable to follow the detail of any
proceedings .  (f) understand the substantial effect of any evidence given against the
person, [WR] was assessed to be able to understand the substantial effect of
evidence given against him in court, with the assistance of
legal advisers and
explanations from his wife.  (g) make a defence or answer to the charge [WR] was assessed to be able to make his version of the events known,
although he had obvious difficulty retrieving information and
communicating in a
coherent way, and would have difficulty giving coherent evidence on his own
behalf.  (h) instruct the person’s legal representative so as to mount a defence
and provide the person’s version of the facts
to that legal representative
and to the court if necessary [WR] indicated how he would respond to the charge. However, he has obvious
impairment in communication that might affect the reliability of
instructions and any evidence he was able to give in court.  (i) decide what defence the person will rely on and make that decision known
to the person’s legal representative and the court. [WR] was assessed to [be] able to decide on which defence to rely on. His condition is by definition permanent and irreversible, and he is unlikely to
become fit within the next twelve months. With regards [WR's] fitness for trial between 15.11.21 and 3.12.21, it is
possible that his condition deteriorated in the months
between the completion of
the trial and the initial interview conducted on 24.1.22. However, based on his
presentation at the time
of the initial interview I believe he was probably not
fit for trial during the period in which the trial took place.” (emphasis
added)   At
this point, six matters should be noted about Associate Professor Rosenfeld and
Dr Nielssen’s opinions about the applicant’s
fitness to stand trial
in late 2021.  First,
in addressing the criterion in s 36(1)(e) of the MHCIFP Act, Dr Nielssen opined
on the applicant’s ability to follow
the “detail” of any
proceedings. This does not properly address s 36(1)(e), which is addressed to
whether the accused
can follow the proceedings “in a general sense”.  Second,
in relation to s 36(1)(h), Dr Nielssen’s opinion rises no higher than that
the applicant’s impairment in communication
“might” have
affected the reliability of his instructions and evidence.  Third,
in respect of s 36(1)(g), even though Dr Nielssen concluded that the applicant
was unfit because of the effect of his cognitive
impairment on his ability to
give “coherent evidence”, Dr Nielssen also concluded that he was
“able to make his
version of the events known”.  Fourth,
although Associate Professor Rosenfeld addressed the applicant’s medical
condition (namely, vascular brain disease)
at length, the basis of his opinion
that the applicant was unfit to stand trial is not explained. As was pointed out
in argument,
the effect of dementia on a person’s fitness to stand trial
is a matter of degree. It is also partly dependent on the particular
circumstances of the trial. There does not appear to be any specific
consideration, on the part of either Associate Professor Rosenfeld
or Dr
Nielssen, of the circumstances of the trial that the applicant in fact
faced.  Fifth,
and consistent with the point just made, it can be expected that the experienced
Senior Counsel who acted for the applicant
at trial would have insight into each
of the matters identified by Dr Nielssen and Associate Professor Rosenfeld,
given that he conducted
the trial and called the applicant to give evidence. The
Court was advised that that Senior Counsel has not yet been approached to
give
evidence.  Sixth,
each of the matters identified by Dr Nielssen can be checked against the
transcript of the applicant’s evidence at the
trial, bearing in mind the
points noted in [13] and [14] above. Crown Evidence on
Fitness   The
Crown tendered a limited amount of material obtained from Justice Health. This
included a report from Dr Jacques Ette, a general
practitioner, which was
tendered at the applicant’s sentence hearing. The report outlined
assessments of the applicant undertaken
upon his entry into custody and the
manner in which Justice Health addressed his various medical conditions. Dr Ette
noted the effect
of Associate Professor Rosenfeld and Dr Nielssen’s
reports but added that there was no mention of the applicant suffering from
dementia in the health summary provided by his general practitioner.  The
Crown also tendered notes from the applicant’s Justice Health file for
various days between February 2022 and February 2023,
some of which were
tendered to show the level of care provided to the applicant. The notes also
included observations by Justice
Health personnel about the applicant’s
psychological state and cognitive capacity, such as: “[r]eports he does
not have
any mental health
problems”; [6] “[h]is
quality of speech was normal [and] his thought form ... appeared to be logical
and connected”; [7] and
“presents as
logical/articulate”. [8]  Leaving
aside this material, the Court was advised that the Crown was not able to obtain
reports responsive to the reports of Associate
Professor Rosenfeld and Dr
Nielssen in time for the hearing of this application, although it anticipates
having those reports by
the time the appeal is heard. The applicant’s
Notice of Appeal (and the submissions in support) were filed by October 2022.
The application for bail pending appeal was filed on 28 November 2022. Although
it has been over three months since the bail application
was filed, and the
basis for the appeal has been fully articulated, it can be accepted that the
period over which that occurred could
make it difficult to obtain responsive
reports, at least in the relatively narrow field of forensic psychiatry. In the
end result,
the Court must make its assessment based on the material that was
presented while allowing for the circumstance that the Crown has
not yet had the
full opportunity to obtain material in response. Assessment of
Prospects   Senior
Counsel for the applicant in this Court, Mr Game SC, submitted that, having
regard to the relatively low threshold for success
on ground 1 of the appeal,
the Court should find that the applicant is “most likely to succeed”
on appeal. The matters
noted above at [22]–[28], and the fact that the
evidence concerning the applicant’s fitness is not yet complete, mean
that
I do not accept that submission. Nevertheless, I accept that the applicant has
at least reasonable prospects of success in establishing
that there is
“ a question about the propriety of the conviction because [the
applicant] may have been unfit to stand trial” ( RTI supra ). It is
simply not possible at this point to make any assessment as to whether, if that
threshold was overcome, the Crown would establish
that a court acting reasonably
must have found that the applicant was fit to stand trial. However, at the risk
of stating the obvious,
if that point is reached then the burden of
demonstrating the applicant’s fitness will be on the Crown.  Other Evidence   Three
other aspects of the evidence adduced on the bail application should be
noted.  First,
as noted, the evidence travelled beyond addressing the applicant’s
cognitive decline. He is presently 85 years of age
and has a series of medical
conditions beyond his cognitive decline, including vascular and heart disease,
sleep apnoea and lung
disease that leaves him short of breath, as well as
age-related physical frailty including hip replacements, a knee replacement,
a
shoulder operation and the like. Given the competing evidence, I am not in a
position to make any finding to the effect that his
various medical conditions
are not being adequately cared for in custody. Nevertheless, it can be accepted
that he is vulnerable
and has a limited life expectancy, although they were
matters that were presumably known to the sentencing judge.  Second,
the applicant’s wife affirmed an affidavit in support of the application
for bail. She noted that, prior to entering
custody, the applicant owned and
operated a bakery for 45 years. She deposed to having suffered a significant
accident in April 2022,
as a result of which she broke her C5 vertebrae. She
said that she is in a wheelchair and described herself as a quadriplegic,
although
there is evidence that she can drive a car. She stated that she
“desperately want[s] [the applicant] to return home to help
me with
everyday life and running the bakery”. She also agreed to accompany the
applicant outside of their home as part of
any bail conditions and agreed to
forfeit a sum without security if he fails to comply with his bail conditions.
Her desire for the
return of her husband is understandable. However, given that
the premise of the application for bail is that the applicant is suffering
from
dementia and is physically frail, no allowance can be made for any assistance
the applicant might provide her or for his conduct
of the family business.  Third,
the applicant was on bail for five years prior to his trial. There is no
suggestion that he did not comply with his bail conditions
during that
period. Special or Exceptional Circumstances   The
applicant did not seek to establish special or exceptional circumstances solely
by reference to the prospects of success on appeal.
Instead, consistent with El Khouli , the applicant also contends that by the time his appeal is
heard, or at least decided, he would have spent a substantial part of
his
minimum non-parole period in custody, i.e. the applicant relies on the
interaction between the assessment of the relative strength
of the appeal and
the utility of the appeal ( Fantakis , supra ). The applicant also
relies on his age and vulnerability in custody, a matter that has been
addressed. Those matters do not establish
special or exceptional circumstances
in their own right, although they can cumulatively form part of a finding to
that effect.  The
applicant’s prospects of success on appeal, based on the material
available at present, have already been addressed. If
the Crown’s evidence
in response to Dr Nielssen and Associate Professor Rosenfeld ultimately supports
the assessment that the
applicant was unfit, or at least does not contradict the
applicant’s material, then it is very likely that the hearing of the
appeal in June 2023 will be brief and will resolve in the applicant’s
favour. In that case, a decision to grant bail will be
vindicated. If the
Crown’s evidence contradicts the applicant’s experts, then, to
resist the appeal, it will either have
to argue that, overall, the material does
not raise a question as to the applicant’s fitness or otherwise is such as
to demonstrate
that a court acting reasonably must have found that the accused
was fit to stand trial. It is likely that any appeal addressing those
issues
will occupy more than one day of hearing and will require some (perhaps
significant) time to publish a decision. In those
circumstances, there is a
strong likelihood that the Court’s decision would not be available until
later in 2023, when the
large bulk of the applicant’s minimum non-parole
period will have been served. Given that possibility, my assessment of the
relative strength of the appeal and the applicant’s circumstances, I am
satisfied that special or exceptional circumstances
have been
established. Unacceptable Risk   Having
found that special or exceptional circumstances have been established, it is
necessary to address the relevant bail risks (see ss 18 – 19 of the Bail
Act ; [5] above). I accept that there is a risk to XX and any other
Crown witnesses, albeit not great, and a risk, albeit small, that
the applicant
might abscond. Given his bail history, family ties and personal circumstances, I
am satisfied that those risks can
be reduced below a level that is unacceptable
by the imposition of appropriate conditions.  Following
the hearing of this application, the parties provided bail conditions that it
was agreed should be imposed if the Court
proposed to grant bail. Subject to two
matters, I am satisfied that the agreed bail conditions are appropriate.  The
first matter is that I consider it appropriate to exclude the applicant from any
international point of departure.  The
second matter concerns a proposed bail condition which the parties describe as a
“pre-release condition”. Section 29 of the Bail Act provides:  “ 29   Limitation on power to impose pre-release
requirements (1)   The following requirements (and no other requirements) can
be imposed by a bail authority as pre-release requirements––  (a)   a conduct requirement that requires the accused
person to surrender his or her passport, (b)   a  security requirement, (c)   a requirement that one or more character
acknowledgements be provided, (d)   an accommodation requirement.  (2)   A requirement of a bail condition is a pre-release requirement  if the bail condition specifies
that the condition must be complied with before the accused person is
released on bail.”   The
parties proposed a condition of whereby the applicant is to travel from the Long
Bay Correctional Centre (from which the applicant
is to be released on bail) in
the company of a specified person “who must be in attendance at that
centre before release occurs”.
To the extent that this imposes an
obligation on the applicant, it is a “conduct requirement” and can
be the subject
of a valid bail condition (see s 25 of the Bail Act ),
i.e. if he does not travel with the specified person then he is in breach of his
bail. However, in this case, the parties purported
to designate this condition
as a pre-release requirement. To the extent that it is a conduct requirement it
is not of a kind specified
in s 29(1)(a) and otherwise does not fall within s
29(1). I decline to designate the condition as a pre-release requirement.  Accordingly,
I propose the following orders:  (1)	The
applicant be granted bail on the following conditions:  Conduct, Accommodation and Curfew Conditions a.   The applicant is to be of good behaviour. b.   The applicant is to appear at Court of Criminal Appeal at
Sydney on 13 June 2023 and thereafter as directed. c.   The applicant is to live at XXXXXX and nowhere else. d.   The applicant is to report to the Officer in Charge at XXXX
