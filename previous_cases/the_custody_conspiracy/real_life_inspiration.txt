the offence of entering a building on 30 December 2021
with intent to commit an
indictable offence contrary to s 114(1)(d) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW),
to which he pleaded guilty. It was common ground between the parties that the
indictable offence was the common law offence
of escaping from lawful
custody.  The applicant also sought leave to appeal against his sentence imposed by
Turnbull SC DCJ (“the judge”) on 21 November
2023 in the District
Court where he was sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 8 years imprisonment,
with a non-parole period of 4
years.  The applicant sought leave to appeal against his conviction and sentence on
three grounds:  Ground 1: A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the applicant’s
conviction for the offence of entering a building with
intent to commit an
indictable offence, namely the common law offence of escape, in circumstances
where, on the agreed statement
of facts, the applicant could not in law have
been convicted of the offence.  Ground 2: His Honour erred in determining the commencement date of the
aggregate sentence by reference to the asserted effect of the
applicant’s
parole and previous intensive corrections order having been revoked, in
circumstances where there had been no such
revocation.  Ground 3: His Honour erred in sentencing the applicant in respect of the two
driving while disqualified offences on the basis that
the maximum penalty was
one of 2 years imprisonment, when in fact the maximum penalty was one of 12
months imprisonment.  During the hearing, the applicant sought leave to advance a proposed fourth
ground of appeal:  Ground 4: His Honour erred in failing to find that the applicant was sexually
mistreated in the custodial environment.  The Court held (Price AJA, Ierace and McNaughton JJ agreeing) granting
leave to appeal, dismissing the appeal against conviction, allowing the appeal
against sentence and resentencing the applicant:  As to Ground 1:  (1)	The common law offence of escaping from lawful custody is a continuing
offence: [ 34 ]-[ 36 ], [ 63 ]-[ 65 ] (Price AJA), [ 166 ] (Ierace J), [ 167 ] (McNaughton J).
Whether an escape has ended is a question of fact. It is not constrained by the
imposition of boundaries such as
the lack of immediate pursuit, loss of control
or being out of sight: [ 51 ]-[ 56 ], [ 59 ]-[ 61 ] (Price AJA), [ 166 ] (Ierace J), [ 167 ] (McNaughton J).   R v Tommy Ryan [1890] NSWLawRp 45 ; (1890) 11 LR (NSW) 171 ; (1890) 6 WN (NSW) 162 ; R v Ryan

116 , cited.  (2)	The applicant was in the process of escaping when he entered the premises
and is guilty of the offence: [ 32 ]-[ 33 ], [ 38 ], [ 62 ], [ 68 ] (Price AJA), [ 166 ] (Ierace J), [ 167 ] (McNaughton J).   R v Liberti  (1991) 55 A Crim R 120 ; Meissner v The Queen  (1995)
184 CLR 132 ; [1995] HCA 41 ; Nassr v R  [2015] NSWCCA 284 , cited.  As to Ground 2:  (3)	The commencement date of a sentence is a matter of discretion for the
sentencing judge and a House v The King  (1936) 55 CLR 499 ; [1936] HCA 40 error must be established. The applicant did not establish error: [ 81 ]-[ 85 ] (Price AJA), [ 166 ] (Ierace J), [ 167 ] (McNaughton J).

291 , cited.  As to Ground 3:  (4)	The judge acting upon the erroneous maximum penalty for the driving
whilst disqualified offences had the capacity to materially
impact the aggregate
sentence imposed. Ground 3 was established and it was necessary to resentence
the applicant afresh: [ 86 ], [ 89 ]-[ 91 ] (Price AJA), [ 166 ] (Ierace J), [ 167 ] (McNaughton J).   Kentwell v The Queen  (2014) 252 CLR 601 ; [2014] HCA 37 ; Andreata v
R  [2015] NSWCCA 239 ; Kandemir v R  [2018] NSWCCA 154 , cited.  As to Proposed Ground 4:  (5)	Whilst this Court does not readily receive new evidence, the
Court’s jurisdiction is concerned with the prevention of a
miscarriage of
justice: [ 131 ]-[ 133 ] (Price AJA), [ 166 ] (Ierace J), [ 167 ] (McNaughton J).   Barnes v R  [2022] NSWCCA 140 ; (2022) 299 A Crim R 483 ; Shortland v
R  [2024] NSWCCA 174 , considered.  (6)	Had the fresh and new evidence been before the judge his Honour would
have found on the balance of probabilities that the applicant
had been both
physically and sexually abused at Reiby Juvenile Justice Centre
(“Reiby”): [ 134 ]-[ 135 ] (Price AJA), [ 166 ] (Ierace J), [ 167 ] (McNaughton J).   R v Goodwin  (1990) 51 A Crim R 328 ; Kaveh v R  [2017] NSWCCA 52 ; Da Silva v R  [2024] NSWCCA 216 , cited.  (7)	A finding of sexual abuse is significant and not a matter that can
readily be put aside in a sentencing exercise. The additional
material may have
had a real bearing on the aggregate sentence imposed. The absence of that
material during the sentencing proceedings
deprived the judge of fully
appreciating and considering the circumstances of the applicant’s sexual
abuse at Reiby and in
this exceptional case, results in a miscarriage of
justice: [ 136 ]-[ 137 ] (Price AJA), [ 166 ] (Ierace J), [ 167 ] (McNaughton J).   R v AGR (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 24 July 1998, unrep); R v
Gavel  [2014] NSWCCA 56 ; (2014) 239 A Crim R 469 ;  Nasrallah v R  (2021) 105 NSWLR 451 ; [2021] NSWCCA 207 ; Shaw v R  [2024] NSWCCA 241 ,
cited.  (8)	The additional evidence is admitted and leave is granted to the applicant
to add Ground 4 to his appeal. Ground 4 has been established.
The applicant
resentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 7 years and 6 months
consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years
and 9 months, and a balance of term
of 3 years and 9 months: [ 138 ], [ 164 ]-[ 165 ] (Price AJA), [ 166 ] (Ierace J), [ 167 ] (McNaughton J).  JUDGMENT   PRICE
AJA : The applicant, Abdul Elali, seeks leave to appeal against his
conviction for the offence of entering a building on 30 December 2021
with
intent to commit an indictable offence contrary to s 114(1)(d) of the Crimes
Act 1900 (NSW), to which he pleaded guilty. For ease of identification, the
sequence number of the offence is H85707372/4.  The
applicant also seeks leave to appeal against his sentence imposed by Turnbull SC
DCJ (“the judge”) on 21 November
2023 in the District Court at
Sydney, pursuant to s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).  On
12 May 2023, the applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court at Penrith to the
offences set out in the table below (at [ 5 ]) and was committed for sentence to the District
Court.  On
21 November 2023, the judge sentenced the applicant to an aggregate sentence of
8 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period
(“NPP”) of 4 years,
after allowing a discount of 25% for his pleas of guilty and finding special
circumstances. The aggregate
head sentence was backdated to commence on 20 March
2022 and expires on 19 March 2030, with the NPP to expire on 19 March 2026.  The
table below which was helpfully provided by the Crown sets out the offences; the
maximum penalties for the offences; the offences
included on a Form 1 and the
judge’s indicative

notice of appeal identifies the following three grounds of appeal:   Ground 1: A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the
applicant’s conviction for the offence of entering a building with intent
to
commit an indictable offence, namely the common law offence of escape, in
circumstances where, on the agreed statement of facts,
the applicant could not
in law have been convicted of the offence.  Ground 2: His Honour erred in determining the commencement date of the
aggregate sentence by reference to the asserted effect of the applicant’s
parole and previous intensive corrections order having been revoked, in
circumstances where there had been no such revocation.  Ground 3: His Honour erred in sentencing the applicant in respect of the
two driving while disqualified offences on the basis that the maximum
penalty
was one of 2 years imprisonment, when in fact the maximum penalty was one of 12
months imprisonment.   At
the commencement of the hearing in this Court, the applicant’s counsel, Mr
Lange, sought leave to advance a fourth ground
of appeal:   Ground 4: His Honour erred in failing to find that the applicant was
sexually mistreated in the custodial environment.   Both
parties were granted leave to file further written submissions.  During
the proceedings on sentence, a signed Statement of Agreed Facts setting out the
circumstances of the applicant’s offending
was tendered. Before proceeding
further, it is convenient to summarise the agreed facts for all the
applicant’s offences other
than those relating to ground 1. The agreed
facts relevant to ground 1 are summarised below at [ 23 ]. Summary of the agreed facts  H325335096 (Seq 1 and 2) – enter inclosed lands – larceny
– 18 June 2021   On
the evening of 18 June 2021, the applicant entered the car park of a Millers
Point residential apartment block which was a secured
and enclosed space. The
applicant then stole a bicycle valued at around $400 parked in the car park and
left the area. On two separate
occasions later that night, the applicant was
stopped by police and captured on body worn video in possession of the stolen
bicycle. H85768234 (Seq 1-3) – enter land with intent to
commit larceny – damage property – common assault – 25 July
2021   In
the very early morning of 25 July 2021, the applicant was captured on CCTV
footage entering the car park of a residential apartment
block in Dee Why. The
applicant was seen searching through the windows of parked cars using the
flashlight on his phone, while also
holding a wheel brace and metal pole. He
then approached a motorcycle parked in one of the bays and used the metal pole
to tamper
with and strike the front wheel. He also shook the motorcycle and
twisted the throttle causing damage. The estimated cost of repairing
this damage
was assessed to be $2469.41.  On
that same day at about mid-morning, the applicant was confronted by a female
resident who had called the owner of the motorcycle.
The applicant was
approached by the owner and in conversation told them that he was just fixing
the bike because “some kids
tried to steal it”. Upon the owner
insisting that the applicant remain and wait for the police to arrive, he
attempted to leave
the premises and was closely followed by the owner. At this
point, the owner caught up with the applicant, and the applicant punched
the
owner’s chest with two closed fists. When this occurred, the owner stopped
following the applicant on foot but continued
observing the applicant from a
distance in his car. H85166214 (Seq 1 and 2) – larceny
– drive while disqualified – 20 November 2021   On
20 November 2021, the applicant entered Michael Hill Jewellers in Westfields at
Penrith, stole jewellery from the display area
and left without paying. The CCTV
footage showed that he had successfully picked the lock to a display cabinet and
removed two trays
of pendants, placing the jewellery in the front pocket of his
jumper. The total value of the jewellery stolen by the applicant was
$22,783.
These items have not been recovered. The applicant was also captured driving to
Westfields and leaving when he did not at
that time hold a driver’s
licence and was also disqualified from driving. H317489798 (Seq
1)– break and enter and steal – 25 November 2021   On
25 November 2021, the applicant broke into a residence at St Clair by damaging
the side fly screen and entering through the ground
level window. The applicant
stole several items from the property including two laptop computers, a money
tin containing around $300,
multiple pairs of shoes and jewellery. The total
value of all the items stolen was approximately $12,650, which has not been
recovered. H85882920 (Seq 1) – larceny – 16 December
2021   On
16 December 2021 during the afternoon, the applicant and two co-offenders were
captured on CCTV entering Selected Jewellery in
Westfields at Miranda. The
co-offenders momentarily distracted the store employee as the applicant unlocked
a glass cabinet in the
store and removed four watches. The CCTV footage also
shows the applicant removing a diamond pendant and chain from a mannequin when
leaving the store. The total value of the jewellery stolen was approximately
$21,180, which has not been recovered. In a later recorded
Electronically
Recorded Interview with a Suspected Person (“ERISP”), the applicant
made full admissions of the offending
conduct during the
incident. H91650838 (Seq 1) – larceny – 17 December
2021   On
17 December 2021 in the afternoon, the applicant and a co-offender attended
Angus and Coote inside Macquarie Shopping Centre. The
CCTV footage appears to
show that while the staff member was busy speaking with the co-offender, the
applicant lifted a glass sliding
window of a display case and took four rings.
The applicant is seen on CCTV placing the rings in his pocket and leaving the
store
with the co-offender. The total value of the rings was $11,196, which has
not been recovered. H86031136 (Seq 1) – break and enter
and steal – 27 December 2021   On
27 December 2021 in the early hours of the morning, the applicant broke into the
premises of a Cars 24 site in St Mary’s
and stole a Mercedes-Benz GLA 250.
About two days later, employees noticed that a Mercedes had been stolen, along
with various other
items such as car keys and identification plates. The
applicant was caught driving the stolen Mercedes in the police pursuit outlined
below at [ 18 ]-[ 19 ] (H85199222), and the
stolen items were recovered from inside that vehicle. H85199222

– 29
December 2021   On
29 December 2021, police spotted the applicant driving a stolen Mercedes-Benz
GLA 250 as he passed through Willmot. The Mercedes
was displaying a Victorian
registration number plate belonging to an Audi Q3 8U station wagon. The
applicant’s manner of driving
caught the attention of police who then
followed him. Upon seeing that the patrolling police car had activated its
sirens and warning
lights the applicant started accelerating away. A police
pursuit ensued with the applicant travelling at speeds in excess of the
speed
limit. At one point during the pursuit, the applicant had increased his speed to
approximately 80 km/h in a 50 km/h zone which
was 30 km/h above the speed limit.
The pursuit went on for over 5 kms and eventually ended when the applicant lost
control of the
vehicle and crashed into a tree.  The
co-offender, who sat in the passenger seat, was arrested nearby. The applicant
fled the scene with a police officer pursuing him
not far behind. The officer
repeatedly requested and directed that the applicant get on the ground in order
to be arrested but he
did not comply. The applicant shaped up and threw several
punches at the officer, which did not land, and made threats to
“slash”,
“stab” and “shoot” the officer. He
also placed one arm under his jumper which caused the officer to believe
that he
was holding a knife. The officer in response raised his gun at the applicant.
Once arrested, the applicant was searched and
a small package containing 2.46
grams of buprenorphine was found. Police searched the vehicle the applicant had
been driving and
found a number of items including car keys belonging to seven
cars, three different NSW registration plates, two laptops, black gloves,
a
bunch of power tools, two sunglasses and vehicle inspection forms for several
cars. Ground 1 – common law offence of escape   The
Court Attendance Notice (“CAN”) is as follows:  “ Crimes Act 1900 114(1)(d) Enter building/land w/I commit indictable offence – T1 between 1:15 pm and
1:30 pm 30/12/2021 at ROOTY HILL did enter a building,
to wit, ... Victoria
Road, Rooty Hill with intent to commit an indictable offence in the said
building, to wit, ... Victoria Road,
Rooty Hill.”   Although
the CAN does not provide particulars of the indictable offence, it is common
ground that the indictable offence described
is the common law offence of escape
from lawful custody.  The
applicant also entered a plea of guilty to the common law offence of escape from
police custody. The CAN is in the following terms:  “Common Law (NSW) CommonLaw Escape police custody-T1 between 1:15 pm and 2:30 pm 30/12/2021 At MOUNT DRUITT did, being a prisoner, escape from the lawful custody of
Constable TRACEY and Constable SMITH, members of the Police
Force.”   The
agreed facts for these offences which occurred on 30 December 2021 are as
follows:  “101.   At around 1:15pm Constables Michelle TRACEY and
Jacqueline SMITH escorted the offender from the Hospital to the Police
Vehicle.
The offender was escorted with Police on both sides of him. Whilst walking back
to the car, the offender ripped free from
Police and ran [sic] away from the car
park of Mount Druitt Hospital in the direction of Railway Street, Mount
Druitt. 102.   A foot pursuit ensued from this point where the offender
was chased from the car park Eastbound onto Railway Street. The offender
ran
over two lanes of traffic almost causing a car accident. 103.   The offender continued to run Eastbound onto Kimberly
Street and cut left into an alleyway [sic] leading Northbound onto Victoria
Road, Rooty Hill. 104.   The Offender entered the land and residential premises at
... Victoria Road Rooty Hill and went through the house (sequence 3 placed in
Form 1B), in attempting to escape from police custody. Thereupon he entered
the residential premises at ... Victoria Road Rooty Hill from the
back door and
asked the occupants (victims 1 & 2) to hide him. (Sequence 4-Enter
building with intent). When they refused, he himself closed the front door
and went into the guest bedroom to hide from the police. 105.   When Constables TRACEY and SMITH lost sight of the
accused, they urgently requested further Police resources where a perimeter
was
quickly established. Whilst holding a perimeter as K9 Dog Unit was requested,
numerous members of the Public began to point in
the direction of the driveway
of ... [a house on] Victoria Road, Rooty Hill. 106.   The perimeter was tightened further by the police and they
began to look into and around the backyard of ... [houses in] Victoria
Road. As
Police checked the backyard of ... [the victim’s house on] Victoria Road,
a rear security door was seen by them to
be ajar. 107.   At this time, the elderly female occupant ... (victim 2)
was holding her hands in the air looking extremely distressed. Police
asked the
victim if she needed any assistance. The victim appeared to be fearful and could
not verbally reply. Instead, the victim
was moving her eyes in the direction of
the hallway. 108.   When Police fully opened the screen door, the victim
started pointing inside a bedroom within the house and she informed Police
that
a male intruder was inside her house. Police cleared the room and located the
offender in the guest bedroom of ... [a house
on] Victoria Road, Rooty Hill. 109.   The offender was apprehended by Police and placed under
arrest. Due to the room where the offender was located in was a confined
space
and knowing the violent history of the offender and noting his previous escape
from police custody, Police immediately took
down the accused and arrested him.
Police attempted to place his arms to the rear. Police had to use large flexi
cuffs made out of
a plastic construction. 110.   The main occupant of the premises (victim 1-elderly male)
also spoke with the police at the scene and both victims later provided
statements to the police. 111.   Following the arrest, a further victim approached Police
and advised that the offender ran through her house as well ... [another
house
on] Victoria Road, Rooty Hill. (sequence 3 placed on the Form 1C) In
total, three victims between the two houses informed Police that they did not
give any consent for anyone to enter their property. 112.   The two elderly victims at ... Victoria Road disclosed to
the Police that they were fearful for their safety due to the offender
entering
their premises in such manner and asking them to hide him inside their house. 113.   Once the offender was back in police custody, he was not
violent any longer and began apologising to Police ... 114.   The offender was entered into custody, explained his
rights and then charged with the matters currently before the court.”  Submissions   The
applicant complains that the agreed facts for the offence of entering a building
with the intent of committing an indictable offence
do not as a matter of law
establish the offence. The applicant pointed out that he had pleaded guilty to
the common law offence of
escape from police custody (see [ 22 ] above).  The
single authority in NSW on the common law offence of escape is the decision of
the Full Court of the Supreme Court in R v Tommy Ryan [1890] NSWLawRp 45 ; (1890) 11 LR (NSW)
171 (“ Tommy Ryan ”). In Tommy Ryan, Windeyer J observed
at 196 that the offence of escape is a continuing offence. The applicant
contends that Tommy Ryan should no longer be followed.  The
applicant cited R v Scott [1967] VR 276 (“ Scott ”) in
which the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria unanimously declined to
adopt the reasoning in Tommy Ryan . Particular reference was made to the
judgment of Smith J in Scott at 285-286. The applicant submitted that
this Court would conclude that Tommy Ryan should not be followed and find
the reasoning in Scott to be correct. The applicant pointed out that the
conclusion that escape is not a continuing offence is supported by New Zealand
authority
which has considered this issue. In particular, the applicant cited
the New Zealand decisions of R v Keane [1921] NZLR 581
(“ Keane ”) at 583 and R v Kura  [2008] NZCA 337 (“ Kura ”)  at [16].  Referring
to the agreed facts to which he had entered his plea of guilty, the applicant
argued that by the time he had entered the
residence on Victoria Road
(“the premises”), he had already committed the common law offence of
escape. He was no longer
in the direct vicinity of the police officers, who had
lost sight of him. It was submitted that as the applicant could not be convicted
of entering the premises with intent to commit the offence of escape, a
miscarriage of justice had been occasioned and his plea of
guilty should be set
aside.  The
Crown submitted that on the agreed facts, the applicant could in law be
convicted of the offence charged. In addition to Tommy Ryan , Scott and the New Zealand decisions cited by the applicant, the Crown referred to R v Ryan and Walker [1966] VicRp 76 ; [1966] VR 553 (“ Ryan and  Walker ”), a joint judgment of the Full Court of the Supreme Court
of Victoria (Winneke CJ, Hudson and McInerney JJ) at 562, in which
the Full
Court said that while an accused would be liable for the offence of escape
immediately upon exiting a prison, it did not
necessarily follow that an accused
was “not still committing the offence at the stage when he is in the act
of making good
his escape after his emergence”. The Crown submitted that
insofar as it may be suggested that Ryan and Walker stands for the
authority that a person is only committing the offence of escaping lawful
custody when they are in the immediate vicinity
of the area in which the person
originally escaped, this submission should be rejected.  The
Crown argued that the applicant’s contention that Scott and the New
Zealand decisions are authorities for the proposition that the common law
offence of escaping lawful custody is complete
when the offender is no longer in
the immediate vicinity, sight or control of police should be rejected. The Crown
cited a further
New Zealand authority of R v Kafka [1962] NZLR 351
(“ Kafka ”). The Crown pointed out that the New Zealand
decisions were not concerned with the common law offence of escaping lawful
custody
but rather with statutory offences under New Zealand legislation.  The
Crown contended that the offence of escaping lawful custody was not complete by
the time the applicant entered the premises. The
Crown submitted, adopting the
language in Ryan and Walker , that the applicant continued to commit the
offence when he hid in the house “to make good his escape”.  In
oral argument, Mr Lange, submitted that the statute being considered by the New
Zealand cases was similar to the offence of escape
under s 310D of the Crimes
Act . Mr Lange argued that the law of escape ought to be that “a person
escapes from the moment he breaks free from his lawful custody
until such time
as he is no longer under the control of the person exercising lawful authority
nor in his
view”. [1] Consideration   In
order for this Court to grant leave to the applicant to withdraw his plea of
guilty to the offence contrary to s 114(1)(d) of the Crimes Act , the
applicant must establish that upon the facts admitted by the plea he could not
in law have been guilty of the offence: Meissner v The Queen   (1995) 184 CLR 132 at 157 (Dawson J); [1995] HCA 41 (“ Meissner ”). A miscarriage of justice will have occurred if
the applicant establishes he could not lawfully have been convicted of the
charge of entering the premises with intent to commit the indictable offence of
escape from lawful custody by hiding inside that
dwelling house contrary to s
114(1)(d) of the Crimes Act : R v Liberti  (1991) 55 A Crim R 120 at
121 (Kirby P, Grove and Newman JJ agreeing); Meissner at 157 (Dawson J); Nassr v R  [2015] NSWCCA 284 at [5] (Meagher JA, Rothman and Bellew
JJ).  The
question in this ground of appeal is whether the applicant was continuing to
commit the common law offence of escaping from lawful
custody when he entered
the premises or the offence was complete at the time police officers lost sight
of him after he broke away.  It
appears that this issue has not been considered by this Court since Tommy
Ryan was decided in 1890. The relevant principle arising from Tommy Ryan is that the common law offence of escaping is a continuing offence. In that
case, the offender escaped from Grafton Goal and eluded
pursuit for two months.
He was eventually arrested by a police officer without a warrant and taken to a
lock-up at Copmanhurst, where
he was held in a cell. A few days later, the same
police officer entered the cell and attempted to handcuff the offender to take
him back to Grafton Goal, but the offender resisted. During the struggle, the
offender seized the officer’s revolver and shot
him in the face,
incapacitating the officer and then escaped the lock-up. At trial, the jury
acquitted the offender of intent to
do grievous bodily harm but found him guilty
of maliciously wounding although finding that the offender had used no more
force than
was necessary for his escape. The Full Court upheld the
offender’s conviction based on finding that the general verdict of
the
jury was correct.  The
pertinent question for determination by the Full Court was whether the offender
was committing the offence of escaping from lawful
custody when he shot the
officer. At 195-197, Windeyer J stated:  “The view apparently taken by the Chief Justice [Darley CJ] at the trial
was that the offence was complete as soon as the prisoner
got outside the goal,
and that as the arrest was not immediately after the prisoner committed the
offence, the constable had no authority
to arrest him without a warrant. The
view of the law upon this point taken by his Honour appears to me erroneous. The offence of escaping is a continuing offence so long as the person escaping
is keeping out of imprisonment. The offence has no
doubt been committed, and is
complete as an offence for which a man may be punished, directly he gets outside
the gaol gates, though
he should go no further, and be at once retaken; but he
is no less committing his offence because after getting outside he runs away
and
eludes his pursuers. ... In theory, though a man has escaped, his imprisonment is still continuing, and
every hour that he remains out of and is defeating
his imprisonment he is
escaping. ... That the law considers the imprisonment as still continuing when a prisoner
escapes from his confinement is clear.”   Innes
J, at 199, agreed that the offender was still escaping because “clearly he
was trying at the time of his arrest to make
good his escape”. Similarly,
Foster J stated at 216 that:  “[Escape] does not consist, as prison breach, of a single concentrated
act, but is a condition—that of refusing to undergo
imprisonment, and
evading its infliction. It seems, therefore, to be a continuing offence, and the
person is continually committing
this offence as long as he evades the penalty
of his sentence. An imprisonment, in like manner, is not the mere fact of
putting in
prison, and the person guilty of it is in the commission of the
offence all the time that he restrains the liberty of the prisoner
...”   In
the present appeal, the applicant gave the following evidence during the
proceedings on sentence about what occurred after he broke
away from the police
officers:  “Q. You talked about being truly sorry. When you were fleeing police, you
ran into the home of two elderly people, didn’t
you? A. Yes. Q. What do you want to say about that? A. I regret of(as said) what I done(as said). I wasn’t thinking at the
time. I wasn’t in a right state of mind. Q. What about them? They would’ve been terrified. A criminal on the run
comes through their house. A. Yes. Q. Their sanctuary, their castle, something they worked all their lives for.
I’m just making a point to you, that’s all-- A. Yeah, I understand, your Honour. To tell you the truth, I actually asked them
permission for me to hide in their house. One of
them agreed, and then
disagreed, so I left. I know it was the wrong thing to do. Like I said, I
wasn’t in a right state of
mind. I was on drugs. All I was thinking was to
try to get away. It was just the heat of the moment, and the drugs were just
controlling
my mind at the time, and I’m not that person. I - that’s
not me, and I regret what I done and I’m, I’m very
sorry for the
victims. Q. You say they gave you permission to hide from the police? A. They gave me permission, but you could see that they were sort of pressured,
so I left. Q. I might’ve got this wrong, there’s a lot of detail in these
facts. A. Yeah. Q. But weren’t you arrested in the house? A. At the second house, yes. Q. I see, so you fled from that house into another house? A. Yes, I did.”   From
the applicant’s evidence, it is plain that at the time he entered the
premises he was fleeing from the police and tried
to hide to make good his
escape. He was in the process of escaping. In accordance with the principles
enunciated in Tommy Ryan , the applicant is guilty of the offence.  The
applicant places considerable reliance on Scott , a decision of the Full
Court of the Victorian Supreme Court in late 1966.  Scott was preceded by around 5 months in 1966 by the joint judgment in Ryan and
Walker. In that case, the applicants, Ryan and Walker, were charged with the
murder of Hodson, a warden at Pentridge Gaol in Coburg Victoria,
in the course
of escaping from that gaol. Ryan was convicted of murder and sentenced to death,
whereas Walker was convicted of manslaughter.  On
appeal, the applicant Ryan complained that the judge erred in ruling that, for
the purpose of establishing felony murder, the shooting
occurred at a time when
the applicants were committing an offence of escaping from lawful custody
contrary to s 35 of the Gaols Act 1958  (Vic). Section 35 was relevantly
as follows:  “Every male person lawfully imprisoned for any crime misdemeanour or
offence by the sentence of any court of competent jurisdiction
... who escapes
or attempts to escape from any gaol or from the custody of any member of the
police force gaoler or other officer
in whose custody he may be, shall be guilty
of felony ...”   This
offence was later said in Scott by Smith J at 286 to mirror the common
law offence of escaping from lawful custody. The applicant Ryan argued that the
offence of
escaping from lawful custody was complete as soon as he had cleared
the external wall of the gaol. The trial judge ruled that the
escape was not in
fact complete as the applicants had not made good their getaway when the murder
was alleged to have committed.  On
appeal, the view taken by the trial judge was said to be supported by the
decision in Tommy Ryan . In support of Ryan’s contention that the
construction adopted by the trial judge was erroneous, reliance was placed on Keane , a decision of the Supreme Court of New Zealand. The Full Court of
the Victorian Supreme Court (Winneke CJ, Hudson and McInerney
JJ) held that the
trial judge’s construction of s 35 of the Gaols Act  was correct.
The Full Court stated at 562:  “Reading the section as a whole it appears to have been the dominant
intention of the legislature to impose a penalty upon
the persons lawfully
imprisoned, whether in a gaol or elsewhere, in the event of their not remaining
in the state of imprisonment
to which they have been subjected unless lawfully
authorised to leave the same. The view may be accepted that a prisoner who
without
such authority succeeds in leaving the gaol by complete emergence
therefrom has incurred the penalty imposed on him by the section,
but it does
not necessarily follow from this that he is not still committing the offence at
the stage when he is in the act of making
good his escape after his emergence.
Had it been proven, for instance, in what may be regarded as a classic case of
felony murder— Director of Public Prosecutions v Beard [1920] AC
479; [1920] All ER Rep 21—that the accused had killed the girl to stifle
her cries after initial penetration but whilst
still in the act of intercourse,
could it be doubted that he was still in the course of committing a felony? We
think not and for
like reasons in the present case we have reached the
conclusion that the felony created by s 35 was still being committed by the
applicants at the time when they were endeavouring to elude pursuit outside and
in the immediate vicinity of the gaol.”   The
Court was of the view that it was a matter of fact for the jury to determine
when the process of escaping had been completed.
The Court said at
563:  “Although it was not raised as a ground of appeal, it was argued before us
that on this interpretation of the section the question
whether the applicants
had completed the process of escaping from gaol prior to the shooting or were
still in the process of escaping
at that moment was a question of fact for the
jury to determine, and that the trial judge did not leave that issue to it but
instead
directed it on the basis that the escape had not been completed. This
may be accepted, and to that extent the learned judge withdrew
from the jury an
issue which properly should have been left to it. But on that interpretation of
the section, we are of opinion,
having regard to the evidence, that a jury
properly instructed could not reasonably have failed to draw the inference that
the applicants
were still in the process of escaping from gaol at the time of
the shooting. Consequently, even if this point of appeal were to be
decided in
favour of the applicant no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually
occurred.”   In Scott , while serving a sentence of imprisonment at Beechworth Training
Prison, the appellant went missing from a working group clearing
timber under
the supervision of a warder outside the gaol buildings. After the appellant went
missing, he travelled to Sydney and
committed a robbery. On expiration of his
sentence in Sydney, the appellant was extradited to Victoria on a charge of
unlawfully
escaping from lawful custody contrary to s 35 of the Gaols
Act .  At
trial, the appellant gave evidence that during the timber clearing, he was
struck over the head with a piece of wood by another
prisoner, Mr Wilson, and
lost consciousness. When he regained consciousness, he realised he was out of
the custody of the gaoler
and did not want to return to face Mr Wilson who had
assaulted him and had threatened to harm him on numerous previous occasions.
At
issue was whether, if the appellant’s account was accepted, he could be
found guilty of escape at law by finding himself
involuntarily at large and
deciding to remain so.  The
Crown relied upon the decision of Tommy Ryan  to support the
contention that as the offence of escape was a continuing one, the offence could
be committed in circumstances where
the person found themselves out of custody
and “decided not to give himself up”. In rejecting this argument,
Smith J
said at 285:  “I am unable, however, to see force in this argument; for if the offence
of escape was not committed by the appellant at Beechworth
on 2 May, there was
no starting point from which the offence could be regarded as still continuing
at the time when he became conscious.”   It
was against this background that Smith J considered the case of Tommy Ryan  and concluded that it was not “satisfactory authority” for
the following reasons at 285-286:  “In the first place, the view there adopted, that the offence of escape
continues to be committed until recapture, would involve
that, years after a
prisoner had regained his freedom, any person who, with knowledge of the escape,
helped him to avoid detection,
would be a principal offender in an offence of
escape then and there being committed; yet in the long history of this crime
there
is not, so far as I have seen, any indication that such a charge has ever
been laid in respect of such assistance. Secondly, the
suggested doctrine of
continuance is contrary to the view which has long been settled law in New
Zealand: see R v Keane , [1921] NZLR 581; R v Otto , [1951] NZGazLawRp 12 ; [1951] NZLR
602 , at p. 615; R v Kafka , [1962] NZLR 351. Thirdly, the reasoning by
which the conclusion as to continuance was supported in R v Tommy Ryan , supra , does not appear to me persuasive. It was there said that in theory the imprisonment of an escapee continues after
he has gained his freedom. But if this fiction were
adopted it would not be easy
to see how the crime of escape could exist. Moreover, the authorities that were
cited in support of
the fiction appear, upon examination, to do no more than
support two much narrower propositions. Of these the first is that, where
a
gaoler recaptures his prisoner after an escape, the prisoner cannot rely upon
the fact that he was at large in a different county
when retaken, or upon the
fact that the gaoler has been punished for negligently permitting the escape, as
making the retaking and
subsequent imprisonment unlawful. The second is that a
gaoler who has recaptured his prisoner after an escape may dispose of him
as
though he had never escaped, because after such a recapture “in
supposition of law he was always in custody” of that
gaoler: see Hale PC vol. 1, pp. 581, 602: Hawkins PC vol. 2, Ch. 19, s. 12; Anon ., 6 Mod., Case 339; Sir William Moore’s Case  [1790] EngR 1778 ; (1704) 2
Ld Raym 1028 ; 92 ER 183. If for these particular purposes there is a fiction as
between prisoner and gaoler that the actual custody continues, then the case,
as
it appears to me, is one for the application of the principle stated in Hawkins
PC vol. 2, ch. 18, s. 14, that “fictions
of law are never carried farther
than the necessity of those particular cases, which were the cause of the
inventing them, doth require”.
Compare also R v Tommy Ryan  [1890] NSWLawRp 45 ; (1890)
11 LR (NSW) 171 , per Foster, J, at p. 215. Another argument put in that case was that escape should be regarded as an
offence which continues to be committed until recapture
in the same way as
larceny continues to be committed after the commencement of the asportavit and
until its termination. But this
argument by analogy appears to assume the
conclusion to be proved. If one assumes that escape consists in obtaining
one’s freedom
and continuing at large thereafter, the analogy applies in
one way; if one assumes that escape consists in obtaining one’s
freedom,
it applies in quite another way. Yet another reason given was that escape differs from what was conceded to be
the non-continuing offence of prison breach, in being
not a single concentrated
act, but a condition of refusing to undergo imprisonment and evading its
infliction. But to say this appears,
once again, to assume the conclusion. If
one assumes that escape consists in the obtaining of freedom then the act is no
less and
no more concentrated than prison breach. The true legal position is
that prison breach is merely an escape effected by force. A distinction between the two crimes was sought to be made by pointing out that
in Hawkins PC, vol. 2, ch. 17, s. 5 it is said, in relation to escape,
that all persons are bound to submit to the judgment of the law and that
to free
oneself from an imprisonment imposed by law is to be guilty of “a high
contempt”. But Hawkins also states that
prison breach is contempt; and it
seems clear that in calling these two crimes contempts the author was not
intending to express
any view as to whether they were offences which continued
to be committed after freedom had been gained.”   Smith
J then held at 286:  “For these reasons, I consider that there is no foundation for the view
contended for on behalf of the Crown that the offence
of escape is committed
when a prisoner who has not been discharged or released according to law finds
himself innocently at large
and decides not to give himself up.”   Barry
J said at 278:  “The common law was concerned rather with prisoners in custody for trial
than with those imprisoned in execution of sentence
( Encyclopaedia of Laws of
England , 2nd ed., vol. 11, p. 572), and I was at first attracted by the
opinion of the majority of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in R v Tommy
Ryan  [1890] NSWLawRp 45 ; (1890) 11 LR (NSW) 171 ; 6 WN (NSW) 162 , that the offence of escaping
from lawful custody continues while the offender is unlawfully at large, a
decision which was discussed,
apparently with approval, by the Full Court
(Winneke, CJ, Hudson and McInerney, JJ) in R v Ryan and Walker , [1966] VicRp 76 ; [1966] VR
553. However, the exposition of the common law given by Smith, J, is convincing,
and I agree that if the presentment is regarded as charging
the common law
offence, the defects of the judge’s charge to the jury are such that the
appeal must succeed.”   It
is apposite to observe that the factual circumstances in Scott are far
removed from the present case. Critical to the reasoning of Smith J was that the
appellant being rendered unconscious found
himself to be “innocently at
large”. Scott is authority for the proposition that the offence of
escape cannot be committed by finding oneself at liberty and deciding not to
give oneself in, that is, escaping must be a conscious and intentional
act. New Zealand authorities   In Keane, a 1921 decision of the New Zealand Court of Appeal, the accused,
Mr Keane was charged with assisting a prisoner in escaping or attempting
to
escape from lawful custody contrary to s 145 of the Crimes Act 1908 (NZ)
(now s 120 of the Crimes Act 1961 (NZ)). The accused was alleged to have
assisted in the escape as he met with the prisoner outside of prison at a hotel
in Auckland
and lent him some clothes. The question for the New Zealand Court of
Appeal was whether the prisoner was escaping or attempting to
escape from lawful
custody at the time the accused had assisted him. The Court of Appeal expressed
the view that once the prisoner
had regained his liberty it was clear he had
already escaped and therefore, impossible for the accused to have assisted the
prisoner
in escaping. The Court ultimately held that escape was not a continuing
act and introduced a test for determining the completion
of an escape based on
sight and control of police officers or prison officials. Sim ACJ (delivering
judgment for the Court, which
also comprised Hosking, Stringer and Salmond JJ)
said at 583:  “If a prisoner has regained his liberty by getting away from the precincts
of the prison, and also from the sight and control
of all the prison officials,
he then has made his escape, and is no longer in lawful custody.”   In Kafka , a 1960 decision of the Supreme Court of New Zealand, a prisoner
who had been sentenced to life imprisonment for murder, evaded his
gaolers and
hid in the roof of the prison. The accused, Mr Kafka, supplied the prisoner with
food and was charged with assisting
the prisoner in an attempt to escape from
lawful custody. Counsel for Mr Kafka relied on the decision of Keane to
submit that at the time Mr Kafka assisted the prisoner, the prisoner was no
longer in lawful custody and had made good his escape.
TA Gresson J found that
“in reality and in law” the prisoner was still in lawful custody as
he had not physically got
outside the precincts of the goal despite his
whereabouts being unknown. His Honour said at 352:  “He had not regained his liberty and was still effectively and physically
detained within the precincts of the Mt. Eden gaol,
notwithstanding the fact
that his precise whereabouts were unknown to his gaolers ... [The prisoner] was
still physically detained
within the prison precincts, and though in hiding,
which was his first step in attempting to escape, he could in no real sense of
the word be said to have regained his liberty.”   In Kura, a 2008 decision of the New Zealand Court of Appeal,  Mr Kura
had been granted bail on the condition that he not enter licenced premises or
consume alcohol. After locating Mr Kura in a
bar, police officers arrested him
but as they did, he ran off down the road. The appellant remained at all times
within the sight
of the officers. He was convicted by a jury of injuring two
police officers with intent to escape and of escaping from custody. The
question
for the Court of Appeal was whether the appellant had truly
“escaped” because he was never out of the sight
of the officers. The
Court stated the present case was factually different to Keane and that
the real issue was not whether the officers had lost sight of Mr Kura but rather
whether they had lost control over him.
The Court (O’Regan, Chisholm and
Ronald Young JJ) held at [16]:  “The key question as to whether the escape was complete was not whether
the police officers could see the appellant but whether
the officers had lost
control of the appellant. Here the appellant had removed himself from where he
had been arrested against the
will of the police officers. The officers had no
control at that stage over the appellant. His escape was therefore
complete.”   In Kura, the New Zealand Court of Appeal departed from a strict application
of the binary factors in Keane of out of sight and loss of control to
determine when an escape was completed. The Court established that the relevant
consideration
when a person is running away from arresting officers is whether
that person has escaped lawful custody in the sense that the officers
have lost
control over the person after the arrest. In such a case, whether the person
running away was out of sight of the officers
was not required to conclude that
they had escaped lawful custody.  The
reasoning of the New Zealand Court of Appeal raises a number of questions. Is
there any temporal qualification to a loss of control?
Is an escape complete
when a prisoner initially breaks free from the control of the officers but is
brought back under their control
within minutes? Does it accord with reality
that despite a momentary loss of control of a prisoner, that escapee may still
be pursued
and may still hide from officers yet be considered to have completed
his escape? Does the concept of loss of control place an artificial
limitation
on the common law offence of escape (bearing in mind that the New Zealand
authorities were considering New Zealand legislation)? United
Kingdom authorities   Two
UK Court of Appeal decisions have relevantly considered the elements of the
common law offence of escaping from lawful custody:
See, eg, R v Dhillon  [2005] EWCA Crim 2996 ; [2006] 1 WLR 1535 (“ Dhillon ”); R v
Reid (Stuart William)  [2015] EWCA Crim 597 (“ Reid ”).  In Dhillon , the defendant was arrested and after being taken to the police
station, it appeared he might have suffered a knee injury. He was
then taken by
a police officer to hospital to receive treatment. At the hospital, after the
defendant had received his treatment,
he went back into the hospital waiting
room but noticed that no police officers were waiting for him. Seeing no police
officers,
he left the hospital and went home. The defendant was convicted by a
jury of the common law offence of escaping from lawful custody.
On appeal, the
defendant argued that the trial judge had inadequately directed the jury as to
the elements of the offence. The Court
of Appeal allowed the appeal and quashed
the defendant’s conviction because of the inadequate direction to the jury
on the
ingredients of the offence: at [26]-[27]. Steel J, delivering judgment
for the Court, after conducting a review of the relevant UK
authorities relating
to the offence of escaping summarised them at [21]:  “In our judgment, these authorities demonstrate that the prosecution must
in a case concerning escape prove four things:  i) that the defendant was in custody; ii) that the defendant knew that he was in custody (or at least was reckless as
to whether he was or not); iii) that the custody was lawful; and iv) that the defendant intentionally escaped from that lawful custody.”   In Reid , Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, the Lord Chief Justice of England and
Wales, emphasised that the common law offence of escape from lawful
custody was
ultimately a question of fact. In that case, John Anslow was a prisoner and
whilst being transported to court, a gang
of three men attacked the prisoner
transport van and facilitated Mr Anslow’s escape. The applicant, Mr Reid,
had provided Mr
Anslow with a telephone number in a coded Christmas card and
copies of Mr Anslow’s passport were found at Reid’s home.
It was
alleged that the copies were to be used to assist Mr Anslow obtain further
documents. The applicant was charged with conspiracy
to escape.  The
Lord Chief Justice said at [13]:  “... I do not accept that the common law offence of ‘escape’
ended after Anslow left the van and no one was in
immediate pursuit. This is to
impose an artificial limitation. Although the escapee will in due course become
a fugitive, it is a
question of fact as to when the circumstances that are
intrinsically related to the escape end, and his position changes into
‘life
on the run’.”   In
my view, the approach taken by the Lord Chief Justice in Reid to the
common law offence of escape is sensible. It is not constrained by the
imposition of boundaries such as the lack of immediate
pursuit, loss of control
or being out of sight. It accords with common sense and does not overcomplicate
this area of the law. However,
there is a temporal limitation to the offence.
Escape does not continue indefinitely as there will come a time that the escape
has
been completed such that the escapee becomes a fugitive from justice. The
emphasis placed on a factual finding mirrors what was said
in Ryan and Walker in the passage extracted at [ 44 ] above.  In
the present case, as I have stated at [ 38 ] above, the applicant was in the process of escaping
when he entered the premises. A jury, properly instructed, could not reasonably
reach any other conclusion. Should Tommy Ryan no longer be
followed?   Neither
party suggested that a five-judge bench be constituted, although convening such
a bench is not always a necessity before this
Court can consider whether to
depart from an earlier intermediate appellate decision: Moriarty v Nye  [2024] NSWCCA 116 at [98] - [99] (Kirk JA, Wilson and Yehia JJ).  Given
the conclusion I have reached above at [ 62 ], it is not necessary in the present case to resolve
whether Tommy Ryan should be overruled. In any event, I am not persuaded
that Scott and the New Zealand authorities discussed have established
that Tommy Ryan is plainly wrong and that there are compelling reasons
for this Court to depart from it: Gett v Tabet  (2009) 109 NSWLR 1 ; [2009]
NSWCA 76 ; Totaan v R  (2022) 108 NSWLR 17 ; [2022] NSWCCA 75 at [72] - [76] (Bell CJ, Gleeson JA, Harrison, Adamson and Dhanji JJ agreeing).  In
my view, the New Zealand authorities should not be followed in this State. The
common law offence of escape is a continuing offence.
As to Tommy Ryan , I
express my reservation about the offence continuing so long as the person
escaping is kept out of imprisonment. It seems to me
there will be a time when
as a question of fact, the escape has been completed. However, that is not an
issue that arises in the
present case and my observation does not alone justify
overruling Tommy Ryan .  The
applicant has not established that upon the agreed facts he could not in law
have been guilty of the offence. I would dismiss
Ground 1. Ground
2 – commencement date of the aggregate sentence  Submissions   The
applicant referred to the Crown sentencing summary before the judge, correctly
noting that a number of offences had been committed
while he was subject to an
intensive corrections order (“ICO”) or parole. The document also
correctly noted that the
parole had not been revoked as a result of the
offending with which the judge was dealing. This was confirmed by the
applicant’s
custodial history. The applicant pointed out that although
there had been a previous revocation of parole, that revocation was rescinded,
and in any event, related to prior offending which resulted in the imposition of
an ICO. Although it was not referred to in the Crown
sentencing summary, the
applicant’s ICO was also not revoked as a result of his offending.  The
applicant’s complaint was that, when dealing with the appropriate
commencement date of the aggregate sentence, the judge
stated: [2]  “I am going to allow some concurrency with matters that he was previously
serving time for, I think the ICO and balance of
parole.”   The
applicant contended that in doing so the judge fell into error by taking into
account irrelevant considerations, namely the applicant
supposedly having
“previously serv[ed] time” for revocations, which had not in fact
taken place. The applicant submitted
that the judge appears to have
misunderstood his custodial history.  Another
argument was that if the Court was to conclude that the judge had not mistakenly
thought that the applicant’s time in
custody was referrable to revocations
of parole and an ICO, it was nevertheless erroneous for his Honour to proceed on
the basis
of a “notional” revocation of those orders. The applicant
cited Skondin v R  [2006] NSWCCA 59 at [16] - [17] (Simpson J, Spigelman CJ
and Adams J agreeing).  The
applicant accepted that he was not necessarily entitled to have his aggregate
sentence commence on the date of his arrest, since
subsequent to his arrest he
was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 6 months, commencing on 19 January
2022 and concluding
on 18 July 2022 for an offence of driving whilst
disqualified.  The
Crown argued that the judge’s language being “I think”
relating to the “ICO or parole” does not
demonstrate that the judge
acted on the basis that the applicant’s ICO or parole had been revoked.
The Crown also relied on
the sentence summary provided to the judge at the
sentence hearing which stated that parole was neither revoked nor could it be
revoked,
and on the applicant’s counsel’s advice to the judge that
the ICO had not been revoked. Furthermore, both the Crown and
the
applicant’s counsel informed the judge that the applicant had served six
months in custody for an offence of driving whilst
disqualified during the
period of pre-sentence custody. The Crown pointed out that it was by reference
to this offence only that
the Crown submitted to the judge that an appropriate
commencement date was between December 2021 and July 2022.  The
Crown argued that the applicant’s submission that the judge may have
regarded the balance of the ICO as being “notionally
revoked” should
be rejected as there was no mention of the ICO being notionally revoked.
Furthermore, the submission was irreconcilable
with the judge’s sentencing
remarks.  The
Crown submitted that the judge’s mistaken attribution (in somewhat
equivocal terms, that is, “I think”) to an
“ICO and
parole” was not a material error which had the capacity to guide or affect
the determination of the commencement
date of the
sentence. Consideration   In
written submissions to the judge, the Crown had brought to his Honour’s
attention that “although the [applicant] served
a total of 1 year and 10
months overall in custody, 6 months was served in custody whilst serving a
sentence for an unrelated
matter”. [3] The Crown submitted
that “a commencement of sentence date in between 30/12/2021 and 18/07/2022
might be warranted in [the]
courts discretion”.  The
“unrelated matter” referred to by the Crown in written submissions
was an offence of driving while disqualified for
which the applicant was
sentenced in the Local Court to a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months to date
from 19 January 2022 to
18 July 2022.  In
the applicant’s written submissions to the judge, his Honour was informed
that the applicant had been arrested on 30 December
2021 and had remained bail
refused. It was submitted that he had been in custody for about 1 year, 10
months and 19 days. However,
during the period 19 January 2022 to 18 July 2022,
he had served 6 months imprisonment for a sentence imposed in the Local
Court.  In
the proceedings on sentence, during discussions concerning pre-sentence custody
with the applicant’s counsel, his Honour
was informed that the ICO was not
revoked and his Honour should put that aside. His Honour then
said: [4]  “Yes, okay. Not revoked, put it to one side. Yes. Yes, all right.”   It
was made clear by the parties to the judge that the only sentence which required
consideration in the exercise of his discretion
in calculating the commencement
of the sentence was the fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months. However, in his
remarks on sentence,
his Honour
said: [5]  “I am going to proceed by way of indicative sentences and therefore I am
going to proceed by way of an aggregate sentence.
I am going to backdate it. I
am going to allow him some concurrency with matters that he was previously
serving time for, I think
the ICO and balance of parole. There seemed to be a
little window in there as well so in my discretion I am going to backdate it
to
a point in time which will be 20 March 2022.”   By
commencing the sentence on 20 March 2022, the judge backdated the sentence by 1
year and 8 months. As at the date of sentence,
the applicant had served 1 year,
10 months and 22 days in custody, of which 1 year, 4 months and 22 days were
solely referable to
the offences for which he was being sentenced. The
concurrency with the sentence that “he was previously serving time
for”
was 2 months, which suggests that his Honour had in mind the 6 month
sentence imposed in the Local Court.  As
has often been stated, the commencement date of the sentence is a matter of
discretion for the sentencing judge and a House v The King  (1936) 55 CLR
499 ; [1936] HCA 40 error must be established for the applicant’s challenge
to the commencement date to succeed: Delaney v R  [2013] NSWCCA 150 ; (2013) 230 A Crim R 581 at [60] (Hoeben CJ at CL; Harrison and Beech-Jones JJ
(as their Honours then were) agreeing); Refaieh v R  [2018] NSWCCA 72 ; (2018) 272 A Crim R 245.  Furthermore,
it is well established that an error made by a sentencing judge must amount to a
“material error” so that
the sentencing discretion miscarried. As
Wright J (with whom Basten JA and Price J agreed) observed in Rizk v R  [2020] NSWCCA 291 at [71] :  “When a judge acts upon wrong principle or allows extraneous or irrelevant
matters to guide or affect the determination of
a sentence, the sentencing
discretion will have miscarried: Kentwell v The Queen  (2014) 252 CLR 601 ; [2014] HCA 37 at [42] (French CJ, Hayne, Bell and Keane JJ). Nonetheless, in Kentwell it was also recognised , at [42], that not all errors in
the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencing judge’s
discretion. Consequently,
the question may arise whether an error was
‘material’ in that sense.”   The
expression by his Honour of the words “I think” suggests some
uncertainty. However, I am not persuaded that his Honour
had in mind any period
in excess of 6 months which the applicant had served in pre-trial custody.
Should his Honour have been mistaken
in his understanding that that period of
pre-trial custody resulted from a revocation of the ICO and balance of parole, I
am not
persuaded that the error had a material impact on the exercise of
discretion as to the commencement date of the sentence. The commencement
date of
20 March 2022 was well within the proper exercise of his Honour’s
discretion.  There
is no merit in the applicant’s alternative submission concerning
“notional” revocations of an ICO and parole.  Ground
2 of the appeal has not been established. Ground 3 –
incorrect maximum penalty   The
Crown’s concession that his Honour was in error in indicating the
sentences for the two driving whilst disqualified offences
is correctly made and
should be accepted. These are offences H85166214/2 and H85199222/5 in the table
at [ 5 ] above. The
maximum penalty for both offences, being driving whilst disqualified (with prior
offending) contrary to s 54(1)(a) of the Road Transport Act 2013  (NSW),
was a term of imprisonment of 12 months. The maximum penalty had been reduced
from a period of 2 years imprisonment down to
12 months as a result of the
amendments made by Schedule 1, item [3] of the Road Transport Amendment
(Driver Licence Disqualification) Act 2017  (NSW), which commenced on 28
October 2017.  During
the proceedings on sentence, his Honour noted that “the maximum penalty
has been halved”, however he appeared to
overlook this when announcing the
indicative sentences. Unfortunately, this seems to be due to the Crown
sentencing summary which
stated that the maximum penalty was 2 years
imprisonment which was not corrected during the proceedings on sentence. During
his remarks
on sentence, his Honour said that he relied on the maximum penalties
“as set out in the table” and “they are guideposts
in my
sentencing task”. [6]  The
indicative sentence for offence H85166214/2 was 12 months imprisonment with a 12
month licence disqualification. For offence H85199222/5,
the indicative sentence
was 14 months imprisonment with a 12 month licence disqualification. By
indicating sentences of imprisonment
which were either equivalent to the maximum
or in excess of the maximum penalty notwithstanding a 25% discount for the
guilty pleas,
it is plain that his Honour acted on the incorrect maximum
penalty.  In
my view, acting upon the erroneous maximum penalty had the capacity to
materially impact the aggregate sentence imposed. I am satisfied
that an error
of the type referred to in House v The King has been demonstrated: Andreata v R  [2015] NSWCCA 239 at [28] (Beech-Jones J, Ward JA (as their
Honours then were) and Adams J agreeing); Kandemir v R  [2018] NSWCCA 154 at [66] (Price J, Beazley P and R A Hulme J agreeing).  Given
that the sentence imposed was affected by error, it is accordingly necessary for
this Court to re-exercise the sentencing discretion
afresh: Kentwell v The
Queen  (2014) 252 CLR 601 ; [2014] HCA 37 at [42] (French CJ, Hayne, Bell and
Keane JJ).  Ground
3 of the appeal has been established. Proposed Ground 4 –
new and fresh evidence relating to the applicant’s sexual abuse in
juvenile detention   Before
proceeding to re-exercise the sentencing discretion, it is appropriate to
address proposed ground 4 as it is relevant to that
process.  As
has been stated at [ 7 ]
above, the applicant’s counsel at the commencement of the hearing sought
leave to advance a fourth ground of appeal. The applicant’s
counsel handed
up to the Court written submissions in support of that application.  Both
parties were granted leave to file further written submissions.  The
Court has received written submissions from the Crown dated 22 November 2024 and
further supplementary written submissions on
behalf of the applicant dated 4
December 2024 and 18 December 2024.  Shortly
stated, the Crown opposes the application and submits that this Court should
decline to admit the fresh and new evidence tendered
by the
applicant. Submissions   The
applicant’s fourth ground of appeal contends that the judge erred in the
finding his Honour made in sentencing remarks that
the applicant had “been
physically mistreated but not sexually in a custodial environment as he
articulates”. [7] The custodial
environment referred to is Reiby Juvenile Justice Centre
(“Reiby”).  The
applicant contends that the proposed ground is based upon the availability of
fresh and new evidence. The fresh evidence was annexed
to an affidavit affirmed
by the applicant’s solicitor, Ms Howard, on 15 November 2024 (MFI A). The
annexure is a letter from
Gerard Malouf & Partners dated 15 November 2024,
which states that the applicant had received a confidential settlement in
relation
to “a compensation claim for historical abuse”. In her
affidavit, Ms Howard notes that she is instructed that the compensation
claim
settled after the sentence proceedings before the judge.  In
a further affidavit of Ms Howard, affirmed 15 November 2024 (MFI B), a letter
dated 15 February 2023 by the Director of Communities
and Justice to the
applicant is annexed. The letter includes the following:  “I write to you in my capacity as a Director with the Department of
Communities and Justice. On behalf of the State of New
South Wales, I wish to
sincerely and unreservedly apologise for the abuse you suffered within Reiby
Juvenile Justice Centre. ... I am also saddened to read about the physical, emotional and sexual abuse that
you endured during your time spent in juvenile detention.”   Both
the applicant and the Crown agree that the letter annexed to MFI A is
“fresh evidence” as it relates to a settlement
concluded after the
sentence proceedings. Both parties also agree that the letter annexed to MFI B
is “new evidence”.
This evidence was available but not used, or in
the exercise of reasonable diligence able to have been obtained at the time of
sentence: Khoury v R  [2011] NSWCCA 118 ; (2011) 209 A Crim R 509 at [107] (Simpson J, Davies J and Grove AJ agreeing).  The
applicant submits that this additional evidence is material as his
Honour’s rejection of the applicant’s account of
sexual assault must
have led to the rejection of Dr Allnutt’s conclusion, expressed in Dr
Allnutt’s report of 16 August
2021 (“the Allnutt report”), of
there being a causal connection between the abuse and the aggravation of the
applicant’s
various mental conditions.  The
applicant contends that on the basis of Dr Allnutt’s report, the judge
ought to have concluded that his moral culpability
was moderated to a greater
extent than the judge found.  A
further affidavit of Ms Howard was filed on 4 December 2024 without the leave of
the Court being sought. When reminded of the obligation
to seek leave, the
applicant’s counsel sought leave to read the affidavit in order to support
the arguments advanced for the
addition of ground 4. The applicant submits that
this affidavit confirms the reason why the material in relation to the
settlement
was not in possession of the applicant’s solicitors.
Furthermore, it provides the explanation that some of the documentation
was not
available at the sentence hearing because the finalisation of the civil
settlement postdated the sentence hearing.  The
Crown opposed this affidavit being read.  In
this affidavit, Ms Howard annexes a copy of the statement of claim received on
27 November 2024 from Gerard Malouf & Partners
and copies of two letters
from these solicitors to the applicant dated 19 April 2024. The statement of
claim is “new evidence”
and the letters “fresh
evidence”.  The
Crown submits that the additional evidence would not have had a real bearing on
the exercise of the sentencing discretion. The
first reason advanced by the
Crown is that the “fresh evidence” does not identify the nature of
the “historical
abuse” or any terms of the settlement. Secondly, the
findings of the judge as to the sexual abuse did not in this case have
a real
bearing on the exercise of the sentencing discretion as the judge did not reject
Dr Allnutt’s opinion that the abuse
suffered at Reiby aggravated the
applicant’s pre-existing substance abuse disorder. The Crown submitted
that the judge referred,
without demurrer, to Dr Allnutt’s opinion to this
effect. His Honour’s findings that the applicant had been physically
abused at Reiby provided the evidential basis for acceptance of this
opinion.  The
Crown referred to the judge declining to find that the applicant’s mental
health conditions were causally related to the
offending. The Crown pointed out
that Dr Allnutt having prepared his report prior to the commission of the
offences did not proffer
an opinion on this issue. The Crown argued that this
finding was not impacted by the judge’s finding about sexual abuse.  The
third reason advanced by the Crown was that notwithstanding the finding of no
causal connection, the judge did accept that the
applicant had reduced moral
culpability, albeit “only to a limited
degree”. [8]   The
Crown argued that neither the new nor the fresh evidence has the potential to
impact his Honour’s finding or to increase
the degree to which the moral
culpability would be reduced.  Another
argument made by the Crown was that error by the judge had not been established
as his Honour’s conclusion was reasonably
open on the evidence. In written
submissions in reply, the applicant emphasised that it is not suggested that the
judge ought on
the material before him have found that the applicant was
sexually mistreated. The proposed ground of appeal was based on the availability
of fresh and new evidence.  The
applicant submitted that the ultimate question is whether, if the evidence is
admitted, this evidence leads this Court to conclude
that a lesser sentence is
warranted in law.  The
applicant argues that a finding he had been sexually mistreated would have
provided insight into his psychological state and only
with full appreciation of
what occurred could the judge understand the degree to which the development of
his antisocial personality
disorder, in particular, had been affected by matters
outside of his control. A summary of the evidence before the
judge as to the abuse of the applicant at Reiby   The
Allnutt report was not prepared for the applicant’s sentence proceedings
but for his personal injury claim arising from
the abuse the applicant sustained
in 2000 and 2001 at Reiby. The documentation provided to Dr Allnutt included a
sealed copy of a
statement of claim and the applicant’s statement dated 31
March 2021.  Dr
Allnutt recorded that the applicant was at Reiby for two months. The applicant
reported that he was abused by three people –
Julian, Big Mike and Nadia.
The episodes of abuse occurred separately. Julian abused him by coming into his
room and bashing him
around the head and body because he was
“cheeky”. On the second occasion, Julian came into his cell and
started bashing
him. Julian hit him so hard that he lost consciousness. The
applicant woke up with his clothes ripped, the cell locked and blood
coming out
of his anus. Big Mike bashed him physically in his cell a number of times. Nadia
would come into his cell, fondle his
penis and stimulate him until
ejaculation.  Dr
Allnutt was of the opinion that the applicant manifested a constellation of
symptoms consistent with post-traumatic and depressive
symptoms. He was also
diagnosed with an antisocial personality disorder and substance use disorder in
early remission.  As
to the causation of the applicant’s mental health difficulties, Dr Allnutt
stated that “[r]eliably establishing causation
is limited by the passage
of time in cases of historical sexual abuse. Not all victims of childhood sexual
abuse (CSA) develop mental
health difficulties
...” [9]  Dr
Allnutt went on to note that the applicant entered Reiby as a vulnerable youth.
The abuse factors he experienced would have compounded
his antisocial symptoms.
Dr Allnutt opined that the “applicant has likely experienced ongoing
chronic post-traumatic stress
symptoms through his life, which have probably
fluctuated in
intensity”. [10]  Dr
Allnutt reported there was evidence that the applicant “was manifesting
the emergence of an antisocial personality disorder
(conduct disorder) and a
substance use disorder before entering Reiby”. Dr Allnutt noted that
“[a]bout half of children
manifesting conduct disorder in childhood go on
to develop an antisocial personality disorder in adulthood”. Dr Allnutt
concluded,
“[o]n balance, it is likely that [the applicant] would have
continued to pursue an offending and substance-using lifestyle,
but in my view,
the index injury (given the circumstances) aggravated his antisocial personality
and substance abuse
disorder”. [11]  Dr
Allnutt opined that the applicant’s prognosis was relatively guarded. He
stated that “[i]t is fair to say that as people
with antisocial
personality disorder age their offending begins to diminish particularly when
they reach your client’s age,
but his prognosis, at this stage, is
guarded”.  In
addition to Dr Allnutt’s report, the written material before the judge
included an unsworn affidavit of the applicant’s
brother Youssef Elali who
stated at [5]:  “The [applicant] went to juvenile detention from a young age due to the
fact that he didn’t care about getting in trouble.
He spent some time at
[Reiby] and was abused by three different people both physically and sexually.
The [applicant] has been engaging
with a lawyer to commence a civil claim in
relation to the abuse he experienced.”   Justice
Health Records dated 22 May 2022 recorded that the applicant reported
“trauma from physical and sexual abuse at [Reiby]
when he was 13-14 years
old”.  In
his oral evidence before the judge, the applicant confirmed that the first time
he had told anyone of the abuse at Reiby was when
he spoke to Dr
Allnutt. The finding by the judge concerning the
applicant’s sexual abuse   The
applicant does not suggest that the judge’s findings were not open on the
evidence before his Honour. Rather, the applicant
challenges the judge’s
findings on the basis that the availability of new and fresh evidence placed
before this Court was capable
of affecting the outcome of the sentencing
proceedings such that a different and more favourable finding would have been
made in
relation to the applicant’s sexual abuse at Reiby and in those
circumstances, there has been a miscarriage of justice.  It
is apparent that the judge found there were some inconsistencies in the
applicant’s evidence. As to the applicant’s
testimony of the abuse
at Reiby, his Honour
remarked: [12]  “In relation to an account that he was sexually mistreated and physically
assaulted at Reiby, it seems to be said in evidence,
the first person he told
was Dr Allnutt. That is inconsistent given that Dr Allnutt was apparently
provided a report, to confirm
allegations made in the filed statement of claim
of 7 July 2021 as well as an executed statement of 31 March 2021. It seems not
easily
explicable by lack of memory, if indeed this was a wholly truthful and
reliable account and without for one moment wanting to downplay
the seriousness
of sexual misconduct to children, the particulars here are brief. The most egregious aspects at Reiby seem to be violence and then there is an
inference which I am invited to draw of a sexual assault.
There is no actual
assertion as to the mechanism or the enduring consequences.”   His
Honour made the following findings later on in his sentencing
remarks: [13]  “I am prepared to accept that he has some aspects of social
deprivation . I am inclined to accept that he has been physically mistreated
but not sexually in a custodial environment as he articulates. I am prepared
to accept that he has got some disorders which have manifested themselves and
precluded him from developing a moral
compass in the manner of people who were
not similarly treated. Nonetheless, I do not intend to find, and cannot to any standard, that he has a
mental condition which is causatively or contextually
related to the offences
that were committed in this tranche of offending. I am not prepared to accept
[the applicant’s counsel’s]
argument in relation to the extent to
which moral culpability ought be reduced, however I do consider that it is
appropriate to reduce
his moral culpability but only to a limited degree and I
have regard to DS and DM v The Queen  [2022] NSWCCA 156 in that
respect.”  Should the further affidavit be read?   The
Crown opposes leave being granted for the applicant to read the affidavit of Ms
Howard filed on 4 December 2024: see [ 103 ]-[ 105 ] above.  During
the hearing of the appeal, this Court granted leave to the parties to file
written submissions. No order was made granting
leave to file additional
evidence. This Court has emphasised that in only exceptional circumstances will
parties be permitted to
file supplementary submissions without leave after the
hearing of the appeal: Nguyen v R  [2008] NSWCCA 322 at [30] - [31] (Tobias
JA, James and Price JJ agreeing); Roach v R  [2019] NSWCCA 160 at [191] - [192] (Bathurst CJ, Bell P (as his Honour then was) and Johnson J). This
principle must also apply to additional evidence. The hearing
is the time and
place to present evidence.  The
statement of claim and letters annexed to the affidavit could have been obtained
from Gerard Malouf & Partners well before
the hearing.  The
applicant has not demonstrated that exceptional circumstances are present so
that the affidavit may be read. Consideration   I
turn now to the affidavits of Ms Howard affirmed on 15 November 2024 and marked
respectively MFI A and MFI B.  It
is unfortunate that the applicant’s legal representatives in the
proceedings before the judge appear not to have made some
enquiries of the
solicitors who were acting for him in his compensation claim for historical
abuse against the State. The exercise
of reasonable diligence would have
obtained a copy of the letter from the Director of Communities and Justice
annexed to MFI B which
I have quoted in part at [ 99 ] above. The apology in
that letter provides significant support for the applicant’s claim of
sexual abuse. It is not necessary
for this Court to consider any issue bearing
upon the competence of the applicant’s legal representatives in failing to
place
that material before the judge and neither is there a ground of appeal
that makes that challenge: Pym v R  [2014] NSWCCA 182. However, it is
relevant to have regard to the recent decision of Shortland v R  [2024]
NSWCCA 174 (“ Shortland ”), where Stern JA (with whom Cavanagh
and Sweeney JJ agreed) held at [45]-[49] that irrespective of whether there was
any incompetence
of counsel, a miscarriage of justice may arise where
“material evidence was available and relevant to the sentence” but
the applicant was “deprived of the opportunity to have that material
considered in mitigation of the sentence”: at [46].  The
principles relating to the admission of fresh or new evidence on appeal were
summarised by Hamill J (with whom Gleeson JA and
Ierace J agreed) in Barnes v
R  [2022] NSWCCA 140 ; (2022) 299 A Crim R 483 at [24] - [34] (“ Barnes ”).  Whilst
this Court does not readily receive new evidence, the Court’s jurisdiction
is concerned with the prevention of a miscarriage
of justice: Barnes ; Shortland . In this case, the evidence sought to be relied upon by the
applicant is both “fresh” and “new” evidence.
Viewed in
combination with the Director’s letter, a plainly available inference from
the fresh evidence in MFI A is that the
settlement embraced his claim for both
physical and sexual abuse.  The
question remains whether the additional evidence may have had a “real
bearing” upon the exercise of his Honour’s
sentencing discretion: R v Goodwin  (1990) 51 A Crim R 328 at 330 (Hunt J, Grove J agreeing); Kaveh v R  [2017] NSWCCA 52 at [33] (Latham J, Basten JA and Campbell J
agreeing).  I
am satisfied that had the fresh and new evidence been before the judge that his
Honour would have found on the balance of probabilities
that the applicant had
been both physically and sexually abused at Reiby: Da Silva v R  [2024]
NSWCCA 216 at [18] (Stern JA, Dhanji and Faulkner JJ agreeing).  I
reject the Crown’s contention that a finding of sexual abuse would not
have had any impact on his Honour’s assessment
of moral culpability or on
the question of causation: R v AGR (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 24
July 1998, unrep); Nasrallah v R  (2021) 105 NSWLR 451 ; [2021] NSWCCA 207 at [12] (Bell P, as his Honour then was); Shaw v R  [2024] NSWCCA 241 at [56] (Yehia J, Davies and N Adams JJ agreeing). The profoundly detrimental
effect upon a child of sexual abuse is well recognised by this
Court: R v
Gavel  [2014] NSWCCA 56 ; (2014) 239 A Crim R 469 at [110] (Leeming JA,
Johnson and Hall JJ). The applicant was 13-14 years old at the time he was
physically and sexually abused at Reiby.  A
finding of sexual abuse is significant and not a matter that can readily be put
aside in a sentencing exercise. I am satisfied that
the additional material may
have had a real bearing on the aggregate sentence imposed and had it been before
the judge there would
have been a material prospect of the applicant receiving a
lesser sentence. The absence of that material during the sentencing proceedings
deprived the judge of fully appreciating and considering the circumstances of
the applicant’s sexual abuse at Reiby and in
this exceptional case,
results in a miscarriage of justice. As the applicant is to be re-sentenced, the
sexual abuse will be taken
into account.  Accordingly,
the additional evidence will be admitted. I grant leave to the applicant to add
ground 4 to his appeal. I emphasise that
without any criticism of the judge,
ground 4 has been established. Should the applicant be
re-sentenced?   While
the Crown accepts that lesser indicative sentences are warranted for both
offences of driving whilst disqualified, the Crown
argued that when regard is
had to the totality of the criminal offending and the generous finding of
special circumstances (reducing
the non-parole period to 50% of the aggregate
sentence) no lesser aggregate sentence than 8 years imprisonment with a
non-parole
period of 4 years is warranted. A summary of the
evidence before the judge on sentence   Other
than the agreed facts, the Crown tendered the Form 1 documents, the
applicant’s criminal history, traffic record and a
sentencing assessment
report.  The
applicant’s criminal history is extensive with terms of imprisonment
having been imposed for offences of dishonesty including
aggravated break and
entry to commit a serious indictable offence; break and enter a building;
shoplifting and other offences including
driving a conveyance without the
owner’s consent and for dangerous driving in a police pursuit.  At
the time of the offending, as the judge said, he was subject to conditional
liberty being an ICO and was also subject to parole.  The
author of the sentencing assessment report recorded that the applicant had
struggled with drug addiction issues from the age of
fifteen, despite receiving
treatment through the opiate treatment program. The applicant had reported the
motivating factor for stealing
high end items was to support his $600 a day
heroin addiction combined with Zanax and methylamphetamines. The applicant was
assessed
at a Tier 2 Medium/High risk of reoffending.  The
written material tendered on the applicant’s behalf included the Allnutt
report; Youssef Elali’s affidavit sworn 16
November 2023 and a report
prepared by Navin Goonniah, a psychologist. Mr Goonniah was of the opinion that
the applicant’s
symptoms at the time of the offending met the criteria for
Anti-Social Personality Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Substance
Abuse Disorder, Adult Attention Deficit Disorder and Oppositional Defiant
Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder. Mr Goonniah
opined that the
applicant was suffering from mental health impairments for which treatment was
available in a mental health facility.  The
applicant gave evidence before the judge. He confirmed that he had been using
heroin since he was 21, and had been on methadone
for the past six or seven
years. He was also using methylamphetamine. He related that at the time he
committed the offences in June
and July 2021 he was using drugs.  The
applicant said that prior to his offending in November and December 2021, he had
been stabbed in the back by his partner and he
became homeless, living in his
car. He was using drugs. He stole to sell the stolen items for cash and drugs.  The
applicant said he was sorry for the impact caused to the victims of his
offending.  A
letter from the applicant was also tendered in which he expressed his regret for
the offences; his change of attitude and his confidence
in the future with the
support of his brothers and sisters who live in Victoria. Some
findings by the judge   The
judge’s findings on the objective seriousness of the offences were not
challenged by the applicant or the Crown. The judge
observed that the value of
the jewellery stolen from the jewellery stores was not insignificant but were
“not the most spectacular
amounts”. [14] His Honour noted
that the applicant seemed to be a leader in relation to the conduct of
others. [15]  As
to the police pursuit on 29 December 2021, his Honour observed that the
applicant was a disqualified driver and was driving the
stolen Mercedes. His
distance of pursuit was about 5.4 kms. His Honour noted the aggravating features
of brake checking, unheralded
turns, swerving, the extent to which he was above
the speed limit, as well as his conduct towards the following cars and noted
that
this was in a suburban street or series of streets with the real
possibility of other cars and other people coming upon
them. [16]  As
to the offence of entering the building with intent to commit an indictable
offence, his Honour said that it was not surprising
that the two elderly victims
at the premises on Victoria Road disclosed to the police that they were fearful
for their safety due
to what had occurred and the manner in which it had
occurred and from the offender asking them to “hide him inside the
house”. [17]  Other
findings that the judge made that were not challenged include:  (a)	the applicant was entitled to a 25% discount on sentence for the pleas of
guilty entered in the Local Court; (b)	the applicant’s antecedent criminal history should be characterised as
a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law.
This had relevance to the need
for retribution, deterrence and protection of society; (c)	the letter of apology intended to convey remorse as well as optimism about
the applicant’s future; (d)	the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation continued to be guarded as
well as his likelihood of reoffending; (e)	the commission of the offences whilst subject to conditional liberty did not
enhance the objective seriousness of the offences
but did serve as an
aggravating feature on penalty; (f)	where Form 1 offences were attached, they may require the sentence imposed
to which they attach to reflect a greater need for
denunciation and personal
deterrence; (g)	the applicant had a striking record of prison misconduct; (h)	His Honour did not accept that the applicant had a $600 a day heroin habit
but did not reject that he was abusing drugs intermittently
at the relevant
time; and (i)	His Honour found special circumstances being the applicant’s need for
assistance for his drug problems and for psychological
counselling because of
his exposure to violence and his being on the verge of being institutionalised.  Material tendered on re-sentence   The
applicant tendered on re-sentence an affidavit of Ms Howard affirmed on 14
November 2024, which annexed emails from his brother,
Isaac Elali, and sister,
Hanna Elali.  In
his email, Isaac refers to the applicant’s sexual abuse at Reiby and
highlights the impact this trauma had upon his brother.
He refers to the
applicant’s significant remorse and genuine desire to change. He confirms
his commitment to help his brother
reintegrate into society.  In
her email, Hanna refers to the applicant’s genuine remorse and that the
burden of incarceration has weighed heavily upon
him, cutting him off from his
daughter and family members. Hanna asks this Court to see her brother’s
potential for rehabilitation
and transformation.  The
Crown tendered on re-sentence an affidavit of Ms Gadsby, a solicitor in the
Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The
affidavit annexes the
applicant’s custodial history and copies of misconduct reports for
correctional offences on 10 March
2024, 4 August 2024 and 5 August
2024. Re-sentence   The
applicant is now 39 years of age. He was born in November 1985 and was aged 35
to 36 years old at the time of the offences.  The
findings made by the judge [ 149 ]-[ 152 ] are well founded and I will adopt them in
re-sentencing the applicant.  I
should also mention that the offences of break and enter are serious offences.
The property the applicant stole from the residence
at St Clair on 25 November
2021 amounted to a value of about $12,650 and has not been recovered. On 27
December 2021, after gaining
entry to the Cars 24 site, the applicant stole a
Mercedes GLA 250.  The
material contained in the affidavits tendered on re-sentence does not persuade
me to take a more positive view on the applicant’s
prospects of
rehabilitation. The progress that the applicant has made in custody as a hard
working sweeper is diminished by the correctional
centre offences in March and
August 2024. An assessment of the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation
and the likelihood of
re-offending remains uncertain and is dependent upon his
ability to overcome his prohibited drug use upon release.  I
am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the applicant was both
physically and sexually assaulted at Reiby. I accept Dr
Allnutt’s opinion
that this abuse aggravated his antisocial personality disorder and substance
abuse disorder and contributed
to his post traumatic and depressive symptoms. In
my view, there is a causal link between the applicant’s mental conditions
and his offending. The applicant’s moral culpability is reduced and I give
less weight to general deterrence, retribution and
denunciation: Director of
Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa (2010) 79 NSWLR 1; [2010] NSWCCA 194. I am not satisfied that the need for specific deterrence is eliminated, having
regard to the applicant’s history of offending,
the commission of the
offences whilst subject to conditional liberty and his guarded prospects of
rehabilitation and re-offending.  In
assessing the indicative sentences, I have fixed an appropriate sentence for
each offence. Critical to the sentence is the principle
of totality which
requires that the aggregate sentence must be “just and appropriate”: Mill v The Queen  (1988) 166 CLR 59 ; [1988] HCA 70 ; Postiglione v The
Queen  (1997) 189 CLR 295 ; [1997] HCA 26.  The
following table discloses the sentences that would have been imposed but for the
aggregate sentence after the 25% discount has
been applied: s 53A(2)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“ CSP
Act ”):    Charge and Sequence Number    Principal offence and section    Indicative sentence after 25% discount (round figures)      H85768234/1    Enter building with intent to commit indictable offence of larceny  s 114(1)(d) Crimes Act    1 year 8 months imprisonment (taking into account Form 1A)      H85199222/1    Police pursuit (second or subsequent)  s 51B(1) Crimes Act    2 years 4 months imprisonment      H85199222/4    Assault officer while in the execution of his or her duty  s 60(1) Crimes Act    2 years 4 months imprisonment (taking into account Form 1B)      H85199222/5    Drive while disqualified (second or subsequent offence)  s 54(1)(a) Road Transport Act     10 months imprisonment, with a 12 month licence disqualification      H85199222/15    Use class A vehicle with unauthorised number plate affixed  reg 129(1) Road Transport (Vehicle Registration) Regulation     s 10A CSP Act      H86031136/1    Break, enter and steal  s 112(1)(a) Crimes Act    3 years and 6 months imprisonment (taking into account Form 1C)      H85882920/1    Larceny  s 117 Crimes Act    1 year 2 months imprisonment      H317489798/1    Break, enter and steal  s 112(1)(a) Crimes Act    2 years 4 months imprisonment      H85166214/1    Larceny  s 117 Crimes Act    1 year 2 months imprisonment      H85166214/2    Drive while disqualified (second or subsequent offence)  s 54(1)(a) Road Transport Act     10 months imprisonment and a 12 month licence disqualification      H85707372/1    Escape police custody  Common law    12 months imprisonment      H85707372/4    Enter building with intent to commit indictable offence of escape police

have reduced the aggregate head sentence and found special circumstances for the
reasons expressed by the judge. The ratio between
the head sentence and
non-parole period of 50% has been maintained. Orders   The
orders I propose are:  (1)	Leave to appeal against conviction for the offence of entering a building on
30 December 2021 with intent to commit an indictable
offence contrary to s
114(1)(d) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) is granted. (2)	Appeal against conviction dismissed. (3)	Leave to appeal against sentence granted. (4)	Appeal against sentence allowed. (5)	Quash the aggregate sentence imposed in the District Court on 21 November
2023. (6)	In lieu thereof, sentence the applicant to an aggregate term of imprisonment
of 7 years and 6 months consisting of a non-parole
period of 3 years and 9
months commencing on 20 March 2022 and expiring on 19 December 2025 with a
balance of term of 3 years and
9 months commencing on 20 December 2025 and
expiring on 19 September 2029. (7)	The earliest date the applicant will be eligible to be released on parole is
19 December 2025.   IERACE
