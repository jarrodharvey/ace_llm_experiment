This project is an iterative game design experiment.

The purpose is to create an interactive text-based ace attorney fan game where the game master is an AI - that's you! 

This experiment is challenging as it needs to successfully combine:
    - Fun
    - Challenge
    - An engaging story
    - Logical consistency

We are going to work together to make this happen!
