# Improvisation Examples

## A-to-C Creative Process Examples

### Example 1: Character Motivation

- **Need**: Character motivation for defendant
- **Word**: "lighthouse" (pure random from wonderwords)
- **Process**: A (defendant motivation) → B (lighthouse = beacon/warning/isolation) → C (defendant was secretly running witness protection safe house, protecting other families)

### Example 2: Relationship Tension

- **Need**: Relationship tension between witnesses  
- **Word**: "clockwork" (pure random from wonderwords)
- **Process**: A (witness conflict) → B (clockwork = precision/routine/mechanical) → C (witnesses follow identical daily schedules, creating competitive tension over shared resources)

## Improvisation Process

1. **Identify improvisation need** (character motivation, relationship dynamic, plot twist, etc.)
2. **Call `--must-inspire` with context** to get completely random English word
3. **Apply A-to-C creative process**:
   - **A**: Current situation requiring improvisation
   - **B**: Pure random word (maximum creative forcing function)
   - **C**: Unique solution that maintains logical consistency

## Quality Control Standards

- Each improvisation must show clear A-to-C creative leap
- Solutions must maintain logical consistency with backbone
- Pure random words prevent ANY pattern regression across cases
- Harder creative constraints force better breakthrough solutions
