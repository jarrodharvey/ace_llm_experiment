TITLE: Ace Attorney: Shattered Glass

FADE IN:

INT. JEWELLERY STORE - NIGHT

The store is quiet, lit only by the soft glow of security lights. Suddenly, the tranquility is shattered as THREE MEN, disguised with HATS and SUNGLASSES, crash into the store. 

They're armed with IRON BARS, smashing GLASS DISPLAY CASES and terrifying the FEMALE PROPRIETOR. She tries to dial for help, but one of the robbers smashes the phone. 

She's forced to lie on the floor, surrounded by the remnants of shattered glass and the echoes of their threats. Property worth $500,000 is stolen in a matter of minutes. 

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. CHEESECAKE SHOP - DAY

The same men enter the shop. Again, they're disguised and armed. The SHOPOWNER attempts to fight back, but he's thrown to the ground and kicked, suffering abrasions and a dislodged tooth. 

The robbers leave empty-handed, their identities captured on a SECURITY CAMERA. 

FADE TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY 

DONALD JOHN SOLOMON, a man of Aboriginal descent with a criminal record, surrenders himself to the police. His face matches the man captured in the security footage.
