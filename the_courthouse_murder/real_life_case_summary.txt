OF   CRIMINAL APPEAL   2004/3315 CCAP   GROVE J  HOWIE J  LATHAM J   THURSDAY 28 APRIL 2005   REGINA v DONALD JOHN SOLOMON   Judgment   1 GROVE J: I agree with Howie J.   2 HOWIE J: The applicant was sentenced in the District
Court by Judge Ainslie-Wallace (the Judge) for two offences contrary to s 97 of
the Crimes Act , one being an armed robbery and the other an
attempted armed robbery . In each case the maximum penalty
prescribed was imprisonment for 20 years. In respect of the offence of armed
robbery the Judge was
asked to take into account one matter on a Form 1 being a
charge that the applicant allowed himself to be conveyed in a stolen vehicle.
The Judge also sentenced the applicant for an offence of break enter and steal
arising from a breach of a good behaviour bond for
that offence.   3	In respect of the offence of attempted armed robbery the Judge
sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 8 years to date from
5 June 2003
with a non-parole period of 6 years to expire on 4 June 2009. For the offence of
armed robbery, and taking into account
the matter on the Form 1, the Judge
sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 10 years to date from 5 June 2005
with a non-parole
period of 6 years to expire on 4 June 2011. For the breach of
the bond the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for three years
to date
from 5 June 2003. The overall sentence imposed upon the applicant was,
therefore, one of 12 years with a total minimum period
of custody of 8
years.   4	The applicant initially pleaded not guilty to the charges but,
when challenges to evidence in the Crown case proved unsuccessful,
the applicant
changed his plea on the third day of the trial. The Judge allowed a discount of
10 per cent for the utilitarian value
of the late pleas of guilty.   5	The armed robbery offence was committed on 23 December 2002
when the applicant in company with two other persons entered a jewellery
store
in Paddington. The men wore hats and sunglasses by way of disguise and were
armed with iron bars. The female proprietor of
the store attempted to telephone
for help but one of the robbers smashed the phone and she was forced to lie on
the floor. Glass
display cases were broken. Property to the value of $500,000
retail was taken before the men left in a vehicle that had been stolen
earlier
that day. The applicant cut himself during the offence and DNA from the blood
was matched to him. None of the property has
been recovered.   6	The attempted armed robbery took place on 17 January 2003 when
the applicant and another person entered a cheesecake shop in Seven
Hills. Again
both men wore hats and sunglasses and carried iron bars. When the shopkeeper
attempted to prevent the robbery he was
pushed to the ground and kicked,
suffering abrasions to the nose and a dislodged tooth. The robbers were
unsuccessful in their attempt
to take the cash register and left empty-handed.
During the struggle with the proprietor, the applicant’s hat and glasses
came
off and he was later identified in a video of the robbery taken by a
security camera. On 12 February 2003 the applicant surrendered
himself to
police.   7	The applicant was aged 28 years at the time of sentencing and
is of the Aboriginal race. He has a record for offences of dishonesty
and
personal violence commencing in the Children’s Court in 1992. He served
short sentences of imprisonment in 1995, 1998 and
1999. He was placed on a 12
month good behaviour bond in February 2002 for a break, enter and steal offence.
He was in breach of
that bond when he committed the two robbery offences.   8	There were in evidence two psychological reports that
indicated that the applicant’s intellectual functioning was at the
borderline
between mild intellectual handicap and low average intellectual
ability. The Judge rejected a submission that, because of the applicant’s
limited mental capacity, less weight should be given to general deterrence than
might otherwise have been the case. It is not suggested
that the Judge was in
error in this regard. The reports also set out the applicant’s
dysfunctional background and his use of
drugs from the age of 14 when he
commenced using cannabis to the age of 23 when he progressed to heroin. The
Judge indicated in her
sentencing remarks that she could not ignore the
circumstances of the applicant’s past and that they provided “a
cogent
explanation for his past criminal offending”.   9	The sentencing judge took into account as mitigating factors
under s 21A(3) remorse, the prospect of rehabilitation and the plea
of guilty.
As I have already indicated the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea
was 10 per cent.   10	The Judge took into account a number of aggravating factors
under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act but the only
one in contention was that in relation to the effect of the offences upon the
victims. In that regard there were in
evidence two victim impact statements, one
in respect of each of the robbery offences. The first ground of appeal is that
both these
statements contained inadmissible material that caused an error in
the exercise of the Judge’s sentencing discretion.   11	The Crown concedes that there were parts of both of the
victim impact statements that should have been rejected had objection been
taken
to the statements or parts of them. In the case of the proprietor of the
jewellery store, she had referred to the effects of
a second robbery of the
premises that did not involve the applicant. The victim also made comments about
the sentencing process and
the court’s perceived attitude to offenders
that were inappropriate for inclusion in a victim impact statement. However the
statement contained the following in respect of the offence committed by the
applicant:   During the robbery I was crouched on the floor, being screamed at, trodden on
and was constantly being covered in smashing glass
from the cabinets next to me
being smashed, I was absolutely terrified that I would not see my children
again. I cannot get that
feeling of fear to leave me. I suffer constant
nightmares of having glass smashed over me, of being stabbed and cut. He
constantly
screamed at me that I would be killed if I moved, that he would
“fucking kill me” again and again and again. I jump at
the sound of
any car screeching and speeding, instantly taken back to the moments of the
robbery. I have recurring panic attacks
brought on by the terror of the
robbery.  As a result of the robbery I can no longer go to work in our shop for fear of
another robbery, the trauma is constant and real.
I am terrified of guys in
beanies/caps that are so commonplace these days as they instantly take me back
to the robbery. I have tried
hard to move on and done to a large extent but the
vulnerability and fear never ever leave. This has meant a huge economic hardship
to us, huge guilt on my behalf, it’s wrecked our business.  I have been treated for severe anxiety and panic attacks, I found myself a few
months after the robbery to be not coping at all
in day to day life. I was
unable at times to leave the house. I would be sitting sobbing and shaking in
the car in the garage trying
to convince myself its ok to go out but being so
terrified, unable to do so. This permeated through every activity, every day. I
cannot wait in queues in shops as I have this huge surge of fear that it will be
robbed while I am there.   12	The statement of the proprietor of the cheesecake shop, Mr
Pereira, and an associated psychologist report contained references
to the
effect upon him of nine other robberies to which he had been subjected. However,
the statement contains the following:   I must emphasise that this last robbery by Donald Solomon was by far the most
violent and terrifying for me, and has had the most
severe and lasting impact.
As a result of the bashing that I received in this robbery, my face was cut and
bruised and a broken front
tooth was stabilized and a plate requires (sic) to be
inserted. Another condition that remains is that I see flashing lights on the
periphery of my vision at dusk. An eye specialist has diagnosed damage to the
soft tissue of the eye as a result of the impact to
my head of the iron rod used
to bash me during the robbery.  The statement went on to deal with the emotional effects upon him of the offence
in which the applicant was involved including constant
headaches, sleeplessness
and general nervousness.  13	In respect of the effect of the offences on the victims, the
Judge said:   I accept having read the victim impact statements that the robberies occasioned
significant emotional distress which continues to
resonate with both victims and
in the case of Mr Pereira physical injuries some of which persist.   14 Section 21A(2) sets out a number of
aggravating factors that a sentencing judge is required to take into account in
determining the appropriate
sentence to be imposed for an offence. One of those
aggravating factors is contained in paragraph (g) which states “the
injury,
emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was
substantial”   15	The relevance of the effects on victims of an armed robbery
offence to the aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(g) was considered in R v
Youkhana  [2004] NSWCCA 412. In that case the sentencing judge had found
the aggravating factor to be present when he held that there “clearly was
some
emotional harm to the three victims” of an armed robbery offence.
That finding was made on the basis of part of the statements
of two of the
victims describing their reactions to the threats made by the robber. One victim
stated that he “started to feel
scared” during the course of the
robbery and the other stated that he was concerned that the robber might shoot
him when he
pointed the weapon at him. This victim also stated, “I am
still shaken and very nervous as a result of the incident.”   16	The Court held that the sentencing judge was in error in
taking into account those statements as being evidence of an aggravating
factor
under s 21A(2)(g). In particular Hidden J, with whom the other members of the
Court agreed, stated:   [26] However, before a judge could find “substantial emotional harm”
within the meaning of s 21A(2)(g) , one would expect evidence specifically
directed to that issue. Normally, that would be in the form of a victim impact
statement.
Whether that evidence established the aggravating factor would be a
matter to be determined in the circumstances of the particular
case. However, it
would need to disclose an emotional response significantly more deleterious than
that which any ordinary person
would have when subjected to an armed robbery.
There was no such evidence here.   17	As I understand the judgment of Hidden J,
there would need to be evidence of “an emotional response significantly
more deleterious
than that which any ordinary person would have when subjected
to an armed robbery” before the aggravating factor could be found
because
the seriousness with which courts consider the offence of armed robbery offences
generally is based, in part at least, upon
the nature of the threat posed to the
victim and the normal reaction of a person to that threat. The courts sentence
that offence
on the assumption that the victim of an armed robbery would have
been put in fear of death or serious injury by the threats made
by the robber
and the weapon with which he is armed.   18	The relevance of the effect upon the victim of an armed
robbery offence to sentencing for that offence was considered in R v
Henry  [1999] NSWCCA 111 ; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 , the guideline judgment on sentences for armed
robbery offences. The following is the relevant passage in the judgment of the
Chief
Justice:   94 The second body of material to which the Crown sought to make reference
concerned the impact of armed robbery on victims. This
included academic
literature and the report of a clinical psychologist prepared for these
proceedings. This material was said to
establish the objective gravity and
seriousness of the offence of armed robbery. There is no doubt that impact on
victims is an aspect
of the seriousness of an individual offence. General
patterns of impact of the character referred to in the literature to which the
Crown referred, including statistical surveys, confirm the seriousness of the
offence.  95 Plainly the actual impact in each particular case will vary and,
appropriately, cause variations in the sentence imposed. This
is not a
manifestation of inconsistency. Rather, it represents the consistent application
of a principle which varies in its import
according to the circumstances.  96 The surveys and other literature, to which the Crown referred, establish that
armed robbery is perceived as a life threatening
situation for a majority of
victims. In one Australian survey 86 per cent reported the robbery as being the
most threatening experience
they had ever had. Victims experienced both
physiological and psychological problems. The physical effects included chronic
nervousness,
insomnia, nightmares, headaches, digestive problems. Psychological
problems included generalised fear, depression, aggressiveness,
mood changes.
Sometimes the response was such as to develop into the clinical condition of
post traumatic stress disorder.  97 The surveys and academic literature confirm what trial judges and appellate
judges would in any event know, namely, that armed
robbery is a serious offence
by reason, inter alia, of the significant impact it has on its victims. Indeed,
the submissions on behalf
of the Respondents to the Crown appeals did not, in
contrast with criticism of the reliance by the Crown on crime statistics,
challenge
the materials put before the Court on the impact of the crime of armed
robbery on its victims.  98 The Crown also put before the Court a report prepared for purposes of this
appeal by a clinical psychologist on the effects of
emotional distress in the
aftermath of personal trauma, not limited to cases of armed robbery. Nothing in
the report was startling
or controversial and no submissions were directed to
it.  99 This material confirms what this Court would in any event accept on the basis
of commonsense and common knowledge. Armed robbery
is not simply a crime against
property. It is a crime against persons. Furthermore, the fear engendered by the
perpetrator of this
crime, together with the continued adverse effects on its
victims, establish armed robbery to be a serious crime which requires condign
punishment.   19	Because the court assumes, without evidence, that the victim
of a robbery would be affected both physically and psychologically
from the
commission of the offence and because that consequence of the offence is taken
into account generally in determining that
the offence is to be considered as a
serious one requiring condign punishment, it would be unfair for the court to
take into account
as an additional aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(g) the fact
that the victim of an armed robbery suffered the type of harm that is assumed to
be the case for any victim of that offence:
there would be in effect a double
counting of an aggravating feature of the offence. Therefore, in order to take
into account the
effect upon the victim of the offence as an aggravating feature
over and above that which applies to armed robbery offences in general,
something more is required than that which the court has assumed to be the
case.   20	Nothing in Youkhana should be taken to suggest
that the normal or assumed effects of an armed robbery upon a victim are not
substantial. The case is
simply authority for the proposition that, in order to
avoid double counting of aggravating factors, the court cannot take into account
as an aggravating feature of a particular crime the effects upon a victim that
would be expected to result from the commission of
that type of offence. There
may be cases at the margin where some judgment might have to be made about
whether the severity of the
effect of a particular offence on a particular
victim is such that the offence should be considered to be aggravated. But the
present
case is not one of them. In my opinion from the passages of the victim
impact statements set out above it is clear that it was open
for the Judge to
find that the offences were each aggravated by the effect that they had upon the
relevant victim.   21	The Judge referred to the “significant emotional
distress” of the victims whereas the aggravating factor refers to
the
injury and emotional harm being “substantial”. In R v
Wickham  [2004] NSWCCA 193 this Court referred to the importance of
sentencing judges making findings under s 21A(2) in accordance with the words of
the particular aggravating factor being addressed. However, in the present case
there was ample evidence
properly admissible in the victim impact statements to
justify a finding that the injury or emotional harm occasioned to each of
the
victims was substantial and there was no error in her Honour treating the
offences as aggravated under s 21A(2)(g).   22	The offences were each serious examples of their kind. The
Judge rightly observed that the guideline in Henry did not apply
because the offences were not of the kind that fell within the ambit of the
guideline. The first offence was in my
view one falling within the upper range
of seriousness of an offence of its kind by reason of the nature of the offence
and the amount
of property stolen. The applicant could not receive any leniency
by reason of his criminal record and his particular offending was
aggravated by
the fact that he was on a good behaviour bond at the time. In my opinion a
sentence of 10 years was well justified
for the offence and I am not persuaded
that it is manifestly excessive when regard is had to the maximum penalty for
that offence.   23	Counsel for the applicant has drawn the Court’s
attention to statistics for offences of this nature and submitted that a
sentence of 10 years was at the top of the range. That fact itself does not
indicate to me that the sentence was excessive. Quite
frankly, as against a
maximum penalty of 20 years I cannot understand how any lesser sentence could
have been imposed for the offence.   24	The sentence imposed for the second offence was one of eight
years. As I understand the submissions made on the applicant’s
behalf, it
is not suggested that this sentence was itself excessive. This was also a
serious instance of this type of offence by
reason of the actual violence
inflicted upon the proprietor of the shop who had the audacity to try to protect
his property. For
his trouble he was forced to the ground and kicked by the
applicant and his co-offender inflicting injuries upon him of a substantial
nature, to say nothing of the psychological trauma. The sentence imposed was in
my view an appropriate one.   25	There clearly needed to be some degree of accumulation of the
sentences for the two offences, they being completely distinct acts
of serious
criminality.   26	The Judge determined that the overall sentence to reflect the
totality of the criminality was one of 12 years imprisonment. The
submission is
made that the overall sentence is manifestly excessive and again resort is made
to statistical information to submit
that such a sentence exceeds the range for
multiple offences of armed robbery. It was submitted that the highest sentences
imposed
for multiple armed robberies is 12 years and yet in the present case a
discount of 10 per cent was given. Further, decisions of this
Court were relied
upon to show that the overall sentence was excessive when compared with
individual sentences imposed upon particular
offenders.   27	Reference is made to the decision of a two judge bench in R v Tozer  [2003] NSWCCA 72 where for two offences of armed robbery
the applicant received sentences totalling seven and a half years with a
non-parole period
of five years. The submission is that this is an example of
the type of sentence imposed upon persons sentenced for two armed robberies.
However, the robberies in that case were not of the same seriousness as in the
present case and the Henry guideline applied to them. The discount
for the plea was 25 per cent. The subjective features were different to the
present applicant,
some more favourable and some less favourable. The sentence
confirmed by this Court tells me nothing about the appropriateness of
the
sentence in the present case.   28	Reliance is placed upon cases where there were far more
robberies committed than in the present case and yet similar or lesser
sentences
were imposed. For example in R v Trad  [2003] NSWCCA 213 the
applicant was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 12 years with a
non-parole period of 8 years for an aggravated armed
robbery, seven counts of
robbery and attempt robbery and four further offences of armed robbery taken
into account on a Form 1. The
discount was between 10 and 15 per cent. Some of
the offences were committed while on bail. None of the offences individually
were
as serious as those committed by the applicant. This was an application for
leave to appeal and was dismissed notwithstanding that
there had been error
shown in relation to the determination of the discount for the plea.   29	In R v Dorsett  [2002] NSWCCA 326 an overall
sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years was imposed for six
offences of armed robbery with five further
counts being taken on a form 1. The
discount was 20 per cent. The robberies were of the nature considered in Henry , that is offences where the applicant went into stores armed
with a knife and threatened the attendant into giving him money. There
was no
actual violence. The applicant was on parole. The application was dismissed.   30	In R v Gonzales  [2002] NSWCCA 287 a sentence of
12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years for 20 armed robberies was reduced
by a two judge bench to a total sentence
of 10 years and 6 months with a
non-parole period of 7 years and 10 months. The discount was 25 per cent. The
offences were of the
type considered in Henry and there was no
actual violence. On occasions the applicants left the scene without any property
when the victim refused to comply
with their demands. It was held that the
sentence imposed did not reflect the subjective features of the applicants or
the totality
of the criminality. With respect to the members of that bench, I
have difficulty in understanding how the sentences imposed by this
Court
reflected the objective seriousness of the offences.   31	There is nothing in the decisions to which this Court has
been referred that lead me to the view that the sentences imposed for
the two
serious instances of armed robbery for which the applicant was sentenced are
manifestly excessive. Although the total sentence
imposed was at the top of the
range, it was one that it my view was appropriate to reflect the seriousness of
the offences committed
by the applicant and the fact that he was subject to a
good behaviour bond at the time.   32	I would grant the applicant leave to appeal but dismiss the
appeal.   33 LATHAM J: I agree with Howie J.   **********  LAST UPDATED: 	29/04/2005              Print    Print (pretty)    Print (eco-friendly)           Download    RTF format (38.9 KB)      Signed PDF/A format         Cited By    LawCite records    NoteUp references          Join the discussion    Tweet this page    Follow @AustLII on Twitter             About    Copyright & Usage    Privacy    Disclaimers    Help   http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCCA/2005/158.html
