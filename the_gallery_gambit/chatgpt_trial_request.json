      "content": "You are designing an Ace Attorney courtroom battle for 'The Gallery Gambit'. Embrace the series' signature zaniness and over-the-top drama!\n\nTRUE TESTIMONIES: Detective Morrison says he found Marcus with blood on clothes and master key, security footage shows Marcus entering storage room at 8:45 PM. Sarah Chen found the body at 9:15 PM with Marcus kneeling beside Victoria. Diana Blackwood was at charity gala until 11:00 PM. Dr. Wells confirmed Victoria's Monet authentication concerns. Security Chief Blackwell says footage timestamps cannot be altered.\n\nEVIDENCE LIST: Security footage, authentication report, financial records, board access logs, blood analysis, master key, charity gala records\n\nCreate fabricated testimonies with AUTHENTIC ACE ATTORNEY FLAIR:\n\n1. THEATRICAL LIES: Take true testimonies and add dramatic lies/contradictions that witnesses deliver with over-the-top confidence\n2. EVIDENCE ANCHORS: Ensure each lie can be contradicted by specific evidence (this maintains logical gameplay)\n3. ZANY PROSECUTOR: Design prosecutor with impossible quirks, supernatural abilities, or absurd personality traits (reference: Edgeworth's perfection obsession, Franziska's whip, Godot's coffee addiction)\n4. DRAMATIC BREAKDOWNS: When lies are exposed, witnesses should have spectacular meltdowns or reveals\n5. IMPOSSIBLE BUT LOGICAL: Include elements that seem impossible but have logical explanations within the case\n6. GALLERY REACTIONS: Add colorful gallery characters who react dramatically to testimony\n7. JUDGE CHAOS: Judge should somehow miss obvious absurdities while focusing on trivial details\n\nREFERENCE ACE ATTORNEY SOURCE MATERIAL: Think spirit channeling, time travel evidence, witnesses with multiple personalities, prosecutors who throw coffee or crack whips, impossible crime scenes that somehow make sense.\n\nEXCITEMENT CHECK: Rate trial phase 1-10 for AUTHENTIC AA DRAMA and suggest improvements to capture the series' unique tone.\n\nReturn as structured JSON with fabricated testimonies, prosecutor design, and theatrical elements."
