# Ace Attorney Case V6: The Gallery Gambit

## Case Overview (Non-Spoiler)

A murder at an upscale art gallery has all evidence pointing to a recently fired conservator - but Phoenix Wright believes there's more than meets the eye. When art authentication expert Victoria Sterling is found strangled with silk rope, and former employee Marcus Rothwell is discovered at the scene, Phoenix must navigate art world corruption, digital evidence manipulation, and high society deception to uncover the truth.
