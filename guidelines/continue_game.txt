# Guidelines for Continuing Games in Progress
## Managing Ongoing Cases - Lessons from V1-V5 Experience

### Core Principle: Maintain Consistency While Escalating Challenge
When resuming a game, the AI must reconstruct the current state without breaking continuity or accidentally revealing information that should remain hidden.

## Pre-Continuation Setup

### State Assessment Checklist:
1. **Load game state files** from game_state/ directory
2. **Review evidence collected** and what player knows
3. **Check character interaction history** and current relationships
4. **Verify location progress** and areas explored
5. **Confirm failed attempts** and credibility level
6. **Review recent actions** to understand current context

### Critical Files to Check:
```
game_state/
├── current_session.json     # Overall progress and stats
├── evidence_found.json      # What player has discovered
├── character_relationships.json  # Who player has talked to and their attitudes
├── location_progress.json   # Areas explored and current accessibility
├── failed_attempts.log      # Wrong evidence presentations, etc.
└── narrative_context.json   # Where the story currently stands
```

### Consistency Validation:
- **Evidence consistency:** Does collected evidence align with solution files?
- **Character memory:** Do NPCs remember previous interactions correctly?
- **Location state:** Are previously explored areas properly documented?
- **Timeline coherence:** Do player actions fit logical sequence?

## Resumption Best Practices

### Opening Context ("Previously...")
**DO:**
- Provide brief recap of where player left off
- Remind player of current objectives and challenges
- Mention recent discoveries without spoiling future revelations
- Establish current scene and available actions

**DON'T:**
- Reveal information player hasn't discovered yet
- Spoil upcoming plot twists or character secrets
- Reset character relationships to default states
- Ignore previous player failures or successes

### Context Reconstruction Template:
```
"Previously in your investigation..."
- Current location and situation
- Recent discoveries or interactions
- Current challenges or obstacles
- Available next steps (without spoilers)
- Character attitudes based on history
```

### Information Management:
- **What player knows:** Based on evidence_found.json
- **What characters know:** Based on their logical knowledge + previous interactions
- **What's hidden:** Solution files minus player discoveries
- **What's accessible:** Based on current progress and obstacles overcome

## Progression Management

### Difficulty Scaling:
Games should become MORE challenging as they progress, not easier:

**Early Game (0-25% progress):**
- Basic obstacles and unfriendly characters
- Simple bureaucratic barriers
- Obvious evidence locations (still requiring effort)

**Mid Game (25-75% progress):**
- Character relationships become more complex
- Evidence requires connecting multiple sources
- Active resistance from suspects and witnesses
- Previous discoveries create new complications

**Late Game (75-100% progress):**
- High-stakes confrontations with real killer
- Complex evidence chains requiring careful analysis
- Characters with something to lose become desperate
- Time pressure and dramatic tension peak

### Escalation Patterns:
- **Obstacle complexity:** Simple → bureaucratic → personal → dangerous
- **Character hostility:** Unfriendly → uncooperative → actively obstructive
- **Evidence difficulty:** Obvious → hidden → requires deduction → needs confrontation
- **Stakes:** Professional reputation → client's freedom → personal safety

## State-Dependent Behavior

### Character Relationship Tracking:
Characters should remember and react to previous interactions:

**First Meeting:** Default personality (usually hostile/uncooperative)
**After Failed Approach:** More suspicious, less willing to help
**After Successful Interaction:** Slightly more cooperative but still guarded
**After Presenting Wrong Evidence:** Damaged credibility, harder to regain trust
**After Major Discovery:** May become scared, defensive, or try to deflect

### Evidence Presentation Memory:
- **Successful presentations:** Character knows player has this evidence
- **Failed presentations:** Character may reference player's mistakes
- **Credibility impact:** Wrong evidence damages future interactions
- **Learning curve:** Characters adapt to player's investigation style

### Location Familiarity:
- **First visit:** Full description, all available actions
- **Return visits:** Abbreviated description, focus on new elements
- **Exhausted locations:** Clear indication if no more evidence available
- **Changing scenes:** Locations may evolve based on investigation progress

## Common Continuation Pitfalls

### Avoid These Mistakes:

**Inconsistent Character Memory:**
- Characters forgetting previous conversations
- Resetting relationships to default states
- Ignoring player's reputation/credibility changes
- Characters suddenly becoming helpful without reason

**Evidence Continuity Errors:**
- Allowing player to "discover" evidence they already have
- Forgetting which evidence has been presented where
- Resetting evidence locations or accessibility
- Contradicting previous evidence interpretations

**Progress Regression:**
- Making previously accessible information unavailable
- Requiring player to re-do completed challenges
- Resetting character relationships without cause
- Undoing established plot developments

**Difficulty Inconsistency:**
- Making later challenges easier than earlier ones
- Suddenly making characters cooperative
- Providing obvious solutions to complex problems
- Abandoning the obstacle system established earlier

## Advanced Continuation Techniques

### Dynamic Obstacle Evolution:
As player progresses, obstacles should adapt:
- **Bureaucratic barriers:** Paperwork → permissions → jurisdiction issues
- **Character resistance:** Unfriendly → scared → threatened → desperate
- **Evidence access:** Hidden → protected → actively concealed → destroyed
- **Time pressure:** Leisurely → urgent → critical → desperate

### Narrative Thread Management:
- **Main plot:** Client's innocence and real killer's identity
- **Sub-plots:** Character backstories, secondary motives, red herrings
- **Revelation timing:** Major discoveries should reframe earlier evidence
- **Foreshadowing payoff:** Early hints should connect to later revelations

### Player Agency Preservation:
- **Multiple approaches:** Different paths to same information
- **Choice consequences:** Player decisions affect future options
- **Recovery opportunities:** Failed approaches don't permanently block progress
- **Skill recognition:** Reward clever deduction and persistence

## Mid-Game Troubleshooting

### When Player Gets Stuck:
1. **Review available actions** player hasn't tried
2. **Check if new locations** have opened up
3. **Verify character states** - anyone willing to talk now?
4. **Examine evidence combinations** - what can be connected?
5. **Provide subtle hints** without spoiling solutions

### When Game Feels Too Easy:
1. **Increase character hostility** based on current relationships
2. **Add new obstacles** that fit established patterns
3. **Complicate evidence interpretation** - multiple possible meanings
4. **Introduce time pressure** or urgency elements

### When Game Feels Too Hard:
1. **Verify all evidence is actually obtainable** with current state
2. **Check if characters are unreasonably hostile** given history
3. **Ensure obstacles have logical solutions** player can discover
4. **Provide minor hints** or alternative approaches

## Quality Assurance During Continuation

### Success Indicators:
- Player building on previous discoveries
- Characters reacting appropriately to investigation history
- Evidence chains becoming more complex and interconnected
- Challenge level increasing appropriately with progress
- Player showing engagement with deepening mystery

### Warning Signs:
- Player repeating actions without making progress
- Characters behaving inconsistently with established personalities
- Evidence contradicting previous discoveries
- Challenge level decreasing or becoming trivial
- Player expressing confusion about previously established facts

### Consistency Checks:
- **Character knowledge:** What they logically know vs. what they've revealed
- **Evidence timeline:** When things were discovered vs. when they occurred
- **Location states:** What's been explored vs. what's accessible
- **Player reputation:** How credibility affects current interactions

## Session Transition Management

### Ending Sessions:
- **Save comprehensive state** including narrative context
- **Document current scene** and immediate options
- **Record character attitudes** and relationship states
- **Note any pending revelations** or developments
- **Clear stopping point** that makes sense for resumption

### Beginning Sessions:
- **Reconstruct full context** from saved state
- **Verify continuity** with previous session
- **Reestablish current scene** and available actions
- **Maintain character consistency** from previous interactions
- **Continue appropriate challenge level** based on progress

## Final Recommendations

### For Optimal Continuation:
- Always check game state before making any narrative decisions
- Escalate challenge and complexity as game progresses
- Maintain strict consistency with established facts and relationships
- Use player's investigation history to inform character reactions
- Build on previous discoveries rather than abandoning them

### For Player Satisfaction:
- Acknowledge player's progress and achievements
- Make previous efforts feel meaningful and consequential
- Provide sense of forward momentum despite obstacles
- Reward persistence and clever deduction
- Maintain mystery and tension throughout

### For Narrative Coherence:
- Ensure all plot threads connect logically
- Use established character personalities consistently
- Build toward satisfying resolution of all mysteries
- Make final revelations feel earned through player effort
- Tie loose ends together in logical, satisfying conclusion

Remember: Continuation is about maintaining the uphill battle while honoring the player's journey. Every resumed session should feel like a natural extension of the investigation, with challenges that build on what came before while pushing toward an eventual breakthrough.
